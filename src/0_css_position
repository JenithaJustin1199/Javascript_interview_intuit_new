| static        | Yes                  | Normal document flow                                                 | Yes                    | Scrolls normally                     | Default content, Grid/Flex layouts                 | Default state. `top/left/z-index` do nothing. Most modern layouts should rely on this with Grid/Flex. |
| relative      | Yes                  | Its original position                                                | Yes (keeps space)      | Scrolls normally                     | Creating positioning context, small visual offsets | Rarely used to move elements; mainly used to anchor absolute children.                                |
| absolute      | No                   | Nearest positioned ancestor (relative/absolute/fixed), else viewport | No                     | Scrolls with page                    | Tooltips, badges, dropdowns, overlays              | Removed from flow. Parent **must** be positioned. Avoid using for layout structure.                   |
| fixed         | No                   | Viewport                                                             | No                     | Does NOT scroll                      | Sticky headers, floating buttons, chat widgets     | Can overlap content. Must manage body padding and accessibility carefully.                            |
| sticky        | Yes → No (on scroll) | Nearest scroll container                                             | Yes initially          | Scrolls until threshold, then sticks | Section headers, table headers                     | Parent overflow breaks it. Needs `top/left` to activate. Hybrid behavior.                             |
