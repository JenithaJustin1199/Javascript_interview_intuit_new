he SOLID principles are a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. They were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym stands for:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change.
It states that a class should have only one responsibility or job.
Each class or module should focus on a specific task, and if there are multiple reasons to change, those should be separated into different classes or modules.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
It encourages the use of abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism to allow new functionalities to be added without altering existing code.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
It ensures that objects of derived classes can be used in place of objects of the base class without introducing errors.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
It promotes the idea of having small, specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones. Classes should not be burdened with implementing methods they do not need.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
It encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to create loosely coupled systems.
These principles provide guidelines for creating maintainable, scalable, and adaptable software. Following SOLID principles can lead to code that is easier to understand, modify, and extend over time.
