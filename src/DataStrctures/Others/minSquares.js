If you want to solve the "Get Minimum Squares" problem without dynamic programming, you can use a recursive approach. However, keep in mind that the recursive solution might have exponential time complexity and could be less efficient for larger inputs. Here's a JavaScript implementation without dynamic programming:

javascript
Copy code
function getMinSquares(n) {
  // Base case: 0 squares needed for 0
  if (n === 0) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Initialize the result to a large value
  let result = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

  // Try all possible perfect squares less than or equal to n
  for (let i = 1; i * i <= n; i++) {
    // Recursively calculate the minimum squares for the remaining part
    const subResult = 1 + getMinSquares(n - i * i);

    // Update the result with the minimum of the current choice
    result = Math.min(result, subResult);
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
const example1 = 100;
console.log(getMinSquares(example1));  // Output: 1

const example2 = 6;
console.log(getMinSquares(example2));  // Output: 3
Approach:

The base case is when n is 0, in which case 0 squares are needed.
Initialize the result to a large value.
Try all possible perfect squares less than or equal to n.
Recursively calculate the minimum squares for the remaining part.
Update the result with the minimum of the current choice.
Return the final result.
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this recursive solution without dynamic programming is exponential. It's not recommended for large inputs due to the repeated and overlapping subproblems that result in inefficient calculations
