To find the maximum possible sum by dividing 'n' zeta coins into multiple other coins using the given rules (dividing by 2, 3, or 4), you can use recursion with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. Here's a Python implementation:

python
Copy code
def maxSum(n, memo):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]

    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Divide by 2, 3, and 4, and recursively calculate the maximum sum
    sum2 = maxSum(n // 2, memo)
    sum3 = maxSum(n // 3, memo)
    sum4 = maxSum(n // 4, memo)

    # Calculate the maximum sum considering all possible divisions
    result = max(n, sum2 + sum3 + sum4)

    # Memoize the result
    memo[n] = result

    return result

# Example usage:
n = 12
memo = {}
result = maxSum(n, memo)
print(result)  # Output: 13
In this example, the maxSum function recursively calculates the maximum sum by dividing 'n' into coins of 2, 3, and 4. Memoization is used to store and retrieve previously calculated results to avoid redundant computations.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) due to memoization. The function will only calculate the result for each value of 'n' once, and subsequent calls will retrieve the precomputed result from the memoization table.
