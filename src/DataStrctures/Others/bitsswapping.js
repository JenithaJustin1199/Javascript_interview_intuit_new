Given a binary string where we need to swap '0s' with '01' and '1s' with '10' till 'k'-iterations and then return the literal at the index 'i'
Ex:
String input="01", k=2, i=2

iteration 1-> 0110
iteration 2-> 01101001

since i=2, we should return literal at the position i i.e 1 -> give detailed approach, js code with comments, and Time complexity

Approach:

To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of swapping '0s' with '01' and '1s' with '10' for a given number of iterations 'k'. We can iterate through each character of the string and perform the specified swaps according to the rules. After completing the required iterations, we return the character at the given index 'i'.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

Iterate 'k' times to simulate the swapping process.
In each iteration, create a temporary string to store the result of the swaps.
Iterate through the characters of the original string and apply the swaps according to the rules.
After completing 'k' iterations, return the character at index 'i' in the final string.
JavaScript Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function swapBinaryString(input, k, i) {
  for (let iteration = 0; iteration < k; iteration++) {
    let tempString = "";

    // Iterate through each character and perform the swaps
    for (let j = 0; j < input.length; j++) {
      if (input[j] === "0") {
        tempString += "01";
      } else {
        tempString += "10";
      }
    }

    // Update the original string with the result of swaps
    input = tempString;
  }

  // Return the character at index 'i' in the final string
  return input[i];
}

// Example usage:
const inputString = "01";
const iterations = 2;
const indexToReturn = 2;

const result = swapBinaryString(inputString, iterations, indexToReturn);
console.log(result); // Output: 1
