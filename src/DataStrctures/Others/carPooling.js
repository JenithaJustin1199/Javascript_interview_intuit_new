Approach:

To solve this problem, we can simulate the process of picking up and dropping off passengers at each location. We can maintain a variable to represent the current number of passengers in the car and iterate through the trips. At each trip, we update the current number of passengers based on the pick-up and drop-off information.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

Create an array to represent the changes in the number of passengers at each location.
Iterate through the trips and update the array based on pick-up and drop-off information.
After processing all the trips, iterate through the array to check if the cumulative sum stays within the capacity at all points.
If the cumulative sum exceeds the capacity at any point, return false; otherwise, return true.
JavaScript Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function carPooling(trips, capacity) {
  // Create an array to represent changes in the number of passengers at each location
  const changes = Array(1001).fill(0);

  // Update the array based on pick-up and drop-off information
  for (const trip of trips) {
    const passengers = trip[0];
    const pickUp = trip[1];
    const dropOff = trip[2];

    changes[pickUp] += passengers;
    changes[dropOff] -= passengers;
  }

  // Check if the cumulative sum stays within the capacity at all points
  let currentPassengers = 0;
  for (const change of changes) {
    currentPassengers += change;
    if (currentPassengers > capacity) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // If the cumulative sum never exceeds the capacity, return true
  return true;
}

// Example usage:
const example1 = [[2, 1, 5], [3, 3, 7]];
const capacity1 = 4;
console.log(carPooling(example1, capacity1)); // Output: false

const example2 = [[2, 1, 5], [3, 3, 7]];
const capacity2 = 5;
console.log(carPooling(example2, capacity2)); // Output: true
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is

O(N), where

N is the number of trips. We iterate through the trips to update the array and then iterate through the array to check the cumulative sum. Both operations have linear time complexity.
