
Deleting a node in a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves handling various cases, including the case where the node to be deleted has zero, one, or two children. Let's discuss the edge cases, approach, and provide a JavaScript solution with comments:

Edge Cases:

Deleting a leaf node: The node to be deleted has no children.
Deleting a node with one child: The node to be deleted has either a left child or a right child.
Deleting a node with two children: The node to be deleted has both left and right children.
Approach:

Find the node to be deleted in the BST.
If the node is a leaf, simply remove it.
If the node has one child, replace the node with its child.
If the node has two children, find the node's in-order successor or predecessor (either the largest node in the left subtree or the smallest node in the right subtree), replace the node's value with the successor/predecessor's value, and recursively delete the successor/predecessor.
JavaScript Solution with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = this.right = null;
  }
}

function deleteNode(root, key) {
  // Base case: If the tree is empty, return null
  if (!root) {
    return null;
  }

  // Search for the node to be deleted in the left or right subtree
  if (key < root.value) {
    root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
  } else if (key > root.value) {
    root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
  } else {
    // Node with one child or no child
    if (!root.left) {
      return root.right;
    } else if (!root.right) {
      return root.left;
    }

    // Node with two children: Find the in-order successor (smallest node in the right subtree)
    root.value = findMin(root.right).value;

    // Delete the in-order successor
    root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.value);
  }

  return root;
}

// Helper function to find the minimum node in a BST
function findMin(node) {
  while (node.left) {
    node = node.left;
  }
  return node;
}

// Example usage:
let root = new TreeNode(50);
root.left = new TreeNode(30);
root.right = new TreeNode(70);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(20);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(40);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(60);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(80);

console.log("Original BST:");
console.log(root);

// Delete a node (e.g., delete 30)
root = deleteNode(root, 30);

console.log("BST after deleting node with value 30:");
console.log(root);
Explanation:

The deleteNode function takes the root of the BST and the key to be deleted as parameters.
If the key is less than the root's value, the function is called recursively on the left subtree.
If the key is greater than the root's value, the function is called recursively on the right subtree.
If the key is equal to the root's value, the node is deleted based on the three cases discussed above.
The findMin helper function is used to find the minimum node in a subtree (for finding the in-order successor).
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the deletion operation in a BST is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, it is O(n) for a skewed tree, but for a balanced BST, it is typically O(log n).
