
Explanation:

The provided JavaScript code defines a binary tree structure using a Node class and includes functions to replace each node's value with the sum of its left and right subtree values. The example creates a binary tree, replaces node values with the sum of their subtrees, and prints the resulting tree.

Approach:

The Node class is used to represent nodes in the binary tree. Each node has a value (val), a left child (left), and a right child (right).
The replaceWithSum function recursively traverses the binary tree in a post-order fashion (left, right, root).
For each node, it calculates the sum of values in its left and right subtrees using recursive calls and stores it in leftSum and rightSum.
The node's value is updated to the sum of leftSum and rightSum.
The total sum of the node's subtree (including the node itself) is returned.
The buildBinaryTree function creates a sample binary tree for testing.
The printBinaryTree function performs a simple pre-order traversal to print the values of the nodes.

javascript
Copy code
class Node {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}

// Function to replace each node's value with the sum of its subtrees
function replaceWithSum(node) {
  // Base case: If the node is null, return 0
  if (node == null) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Recursively calculate the sum of left and right subtrees
  let leftSum = replaceWithSum(node.left);
  let rightSum = replaceWithSum(node.right);

  // Calculate the total sum of the node's subtree
  let sum = node.val + leftSum + rightSum;

  // Update the node's value to the sum of left and right subtrees
  node.val = leftSum + rightSum;

  // Return the total sum of the node's subtree
  return sum;
}

// Function to build a sample binary tree for testing
function buildBinaryTree() {
  let root = new Node(5);
  let leftChild = new Node(3);
  let rightChild = new Node(7);
  let leftGrandChild1 = new Node(4);
  let rightGrandChild1 = new Node(0);
  let leftGrandChild2 = new Node(2);
  let rightGrandChild2 = new Node(5);

  root.left = leftChild;
  root.right = rightChild;
  leftChild.left = leftGrandChild1;
  leftChild.right = rightGrandChild1;
  rightChild.left = leftGrandChild2;
  rightChild.right = rightGrandChild2;

  return root;
}

// Function to print the binary tree using pre-order traversal
function printBinaryTree(root) {
  if (root == null) {
    return;
  }
  console.log(root.val);
  printBinaryTree(root.left);
  printBinaryTree(root.right);
}

// Example usage:
let root = buildBinaryTree();
replaceWithSum(root);
printBinaryTree(root);
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the replaceWithSum function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The function visits each node exactly once during the post-order traversal. The buildBinaryTree and printBinaryTree functions have linear time complexity as well.
