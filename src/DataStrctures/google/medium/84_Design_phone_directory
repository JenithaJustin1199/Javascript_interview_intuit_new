To implement a PhoneDirectory class that manages phone numbers within a fixed maximum number of slots, we'll need to handle the following operations:

Initialization: Set up a directory with available slots (from 0 to maxNumbers - 1).
Provide a Number: Return an available number. If no numbers are available, return -1.
Check Availability: Check if a specific number is available or assigned.
Release a Number: Recycle a previously assigned number, making it available again.
To achieve these requirements efficiently, we can use:

A set to track available numbers.
A queue to manage and retrieve available numbers quickly.
Solution
Here is the implementation of the PhoneDirectory class in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
class PhoneDirectory {
    /**
     * @param {number} maxNumbers - The maximum number of slots in the directory.
     */
    constructor(maxNumbers) {
        this.availableNumbers = new Set();
        this.queue = [];
        
        // Initialize with numbers from 0 to maxNumbers - 1
        for (let i = 0; i < maxNumbers; i++) {
            this.availableNumbers.add(i);
            this.queue.push(i);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Provide an available number.
     * @return {number} - The available number. If no number is available, return -1.
     */
    get() {
        if (this.queue.length === 0) return -1; // No available numbers
        
        const number = this.queue.shift(); // Retrieve the first available number
        this.availableNumbers.delete(number); // Mark it as assigned
        return number;
    }

    /**
     * Check if a number is available.
     * @param {number} number - The number to check.
     * @return {boolean} - True if the number is available, false if it is assigned.
     */
    check(number) {
        return this.availableNumbers.has(number);
    }

    /**
     * Release or recycle a number, making it available again.
     * @param {number} number - The number to release.
     */
    release(number) {
        // Only add it back if it's not already available
        if (!this.availableNumbers.has(number)) {
            this.availableNumbers.add(number);
            this.queue.push(number);
        }
    }
}
Explanation of Each Method
Constructor (constructor(maxNumbers)):

Initializes the PhoneDirectory with maxNumbers slots.
Fills the availableNumbers set and queue with numbers from 0 to maxNumbers - 1, marking all numbers as available initially.
Get (get()):

Retrieves the first available number from the queue and removes it from the availableNumbers set.
If no numbers are available (queue is empty), it returns -1.
Check (check(number)):

Checks if a given number is available by looking it up in the availableNumbers set.
Returns true if the number is available, false otherwise.
Release (release(number)):

Recycles the given number back into availability if it's not already in the availableNumbers set.
Adds the number to both the availableNumbers set and queue.
Usage Example
javascript
Copy code
let directory = new PhoneDirectory(3); // Initialize with max 3 slots

console.log(directory.get());    // Outputs: 0 (first available number)
console.log(directory.get());    // Outputs: 1
console.log(directory.check(2)); // Outputs: true (2 is available)
console.log(directory.get());    // Outputs: 2
console.log(directory.check(2)); // Outputs: false (2 is now assigned)
directory.release(2);            // Release number 2
console.log(directory.check(2)); // Outputs: true (2 is available again)
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity:
get(), release(), and check() operations are 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) on average due to efficient operations with the set and queue.
Space Complexity:

(
maxNumbers
)
O(maxNumbers), as we store up to maxNumbers elements in the set and queue.
