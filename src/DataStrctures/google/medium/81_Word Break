Here's a JavaScript solution for the Word Break problem using dynamic programming. This approach has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ) where 
𝑛
n is the length of the string s. It uses a boolean array dp where dp[i] indicates if the substring s[0:i] can be segmented into dictionary words.

Solution Code
javascript
Copy code
function wordBreak(s, wordDict) {
    // Create a Set for faster lookup
    const wordSet = new Set(wordDict);
    
    // Initialize the dp array with false values
    const dp = new Array(s.length + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true; // Empty substring can always be segmented
    
    // Traverse the string
    for (let i = 1; i <= s.length; i++) {
        // Check all possible substrings ending at i
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            // If s[0:j] can be segmented and s[j:i] is in wordSet, mark dp[i] as true
            if (dp[j] && wordSet.has(s.slice(j, i))) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The last value in dp array tells if the whole string can be segmented
    return dp[s.length];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(wordBreak("leetcode", ["leet", "code"])); // Output: true
console.log(wordBreak("applepenapple", ["apple", "pen"])); // Output: true
console.log(wordBreak("catsandog", ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"])); // Output: false
Explanation
Initialize dp Array: dp[i] will be true if the substring s[0:i] can be segmented using words from wordDict. Start by setting dp[0] = true, since an empty string can always be segmented.

Dynamic Programming Loop:

For each position i in s, check all substrings s[j:i] where 0 <= j < i.
If dp[j] is true (meaning s[0:j] can be segmented) and s[j:i] is in the dictionary, set dp[i] = true and break out of the inner loop.
Return Result: The value of dp[s.length] will indicate if the entire string s can be segmented.

This approach is efficient and handles edge cases well, including strings that can't be segmented.

Certainly! Let's break down the dynamic programming approach for the Word Break problem step by step, using an example to illustrate how we derive the conditions for the dp array.

Problem Restatement
Given a string s and a list of words wordDict, we need to determine if s can be segmented into a sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Dynamic Programming Approach
Define the DP Array:

We create a boolean array dp where dp[i] indicates whether the substring s[0:i] can be segmented into words from wordDict.
The size of dp will be s.length + 1 to account for the empty substring at dp[0].
Base Case:

dp[0] = true: An empty string can always be segmented (by not using any words).
Recurrence Relation:

For each index i from 1 to s.length, we check all previous indices j (from 0 to i - 1).
The condition to set dp[i] to true is:
If dp[j] is true (meaning s[0:j] can be segmented into valid words), and
The substring s[j:i] exists in wordDict (which we can check using a Set for O(1) average time complexity).
If both conditions are met, it implies that the substring s[0:i] can also be segmented.
Example Breakdown
Let's take the example where s = "applepenapple" and wordDict = ["apple", "pen"].

Initialization:

s.length = 12
dp array initialized to [true, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false, false]
Filling the DP Array:

For i = 1 to 12:

Check substrings s[0:1], s[0:2], ..., s[0:12].
Iterating through dp:

i = 1: Substring is "a" (s[0:1])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, but "a" is not in wordDict, so dp[1] = false.
i = 2: Substring is "ap" (s[0:2])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, but "ap" is not in wordDict, so dp[2] = false.
i = 3: Substring is "app" (s[0:3])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, but "app" is not in wordDict, so dp[3] = false.
i = 4: Substring is "appl" (s[0:4])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, but "appl" is not in wordDict, so dp[4] = false.
i = 5: Substring is "apple" (s[0:5])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, and "apple" is in wordDict. Therefore, set dp[5] = true.
i = 6: Substring is "applep" (s[0:6])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, but "applep" is not in wordDict.
j = 1: dp[1] = false.
j = 2: dp[2] = false.
j = 3: dp[3] = false.
j = 4: dp[4] = false.
So, dp[6] = false.
i = 7: Substring is "applepe" (s[0:7])

Similar checks lead to dp[7] = false.
i = 8: Substring is "applepen" (s[0:8])

j = 0: dp[0] = true, but "applepen" is not in wordDict.
j = 1: dp[1] = false.
j = 2: dp[2] = false.
j = 3: dp[3] = false.
j = 4: dp[4] = false.
j = 5: dp[5] = true, and "pen" is in wordDict. Therefore, set dp[8] = true.
Continue Until i = 12:

After iterating, we find that dp[12] will be set to true because s[0:12] can be segmented into "apple", "pen", and "apple".
Final Result:

After filling the dp array, we check the last entry dp[s.length]. If it's true, it means s can be segmented into words from wordDict.
Summary
The key condition for the dp array is based on whether we can segment the string up to a certain index i using previously segmented parts and whether the current substring exists in the dictionary. This allows us to build up solutions for longer substrings based on shorter ones. The overall approach leverages the relationship between substrings and their ability to be composed of dictionary words effectively.
