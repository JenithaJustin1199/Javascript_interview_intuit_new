To solve the problem of adding two numbers represented as linked lists where the digits are stored in reverse order, we can follow these steps:

Initialize Pointers and Variables: Create a dummy node to help with building the result linked list, and set a pointer to this dummy node. Also, initialize a carry variable to handle sums greater than 9.

Traverse Both Lists: Use a loop to iterate through both linked lists until both lists are fully traversed. For each step, sum the corresponding digits along with any carry from the previous step.

Handle Carry: If the sum is greater than or equal to 10, set the carry for the next iteration. Create a new node for the result linked list with the value of the sum modulo 10.

Add Remaining Carry: After the loop, if there's any carry left, create a new node with that carry value.

Return the Result: Since we used a dummy node, return the next node of the dummy node, which will be the head of the result linked list.

Here's the JavaScript code implementing the above logic:

javascript
Copy code
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val, next = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = next;
}

var addTwoNumbers = function(l1, l2) {
    let dummyHead = new ListNode(0); // Dummy node to simplify the result list construction
    let current = dummyHead; // Pointer to build the result list
    let carry = 0; // Initialize carry

    while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null) {
        const x = l1 ? l1.val : 0; // Get the value of the current node of l1, or 0 if l1 is null
        const y = l2 ? l2.val : 0; // Get the value of the current node of l2, or 0 if l2 is null
        const sum = x + y + carry; // Sum the values and the carry

        carry = Math.floor(sum / 10); // Update carry for next iteration
        current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10); // Create a new node with the digit (sum mod 10)
        current = current.next; // Move to the next node in the result list

        // Move to the next nodes in l1 and l2, if they exist
        if (l1) l1 = l1.next;
        if (l2) l2 = l2.next;
    }

    // If there's any carry left after processing both lists, add it
    if (carry > 0) {
        current.next = new ListNode(carry);
    }

    return dummyHead.next; // Return the next node of the dummy head (the actual result)
};
Explanation of the Code:
ListNode Definition: The ListNode function defines the structure for each node in the linked list.

addTwoNumbers Function:

dummyHead: This is a placeholder node to make it easier to build the resulting linked list without needing to handle special cases for the head node.
current: A pointer that keeps track of where to add the next node in the result list.
carry: Keeps track of any overflow that occurs when adding two digits.
While Loop: The loop continues until both linked lists have been fully traversed. Inside the loop:

We extract the current values from l1 and l2 (or use 0 if one of the lists is exhausted).
We calculate the sum of the two digits and the carry.
We create a new node with the digit part of the sum (sum % 10) and update the carry for the next iteration.
We move the pointers of l1 and l2 to their next nodes.
Final Carry: After the loop, if there's any carry left, we create a new node for it.

Return Statement: Finally, we return dummyHead.next which points to the head of the resulting linked list.

Complexity Analysis:

O(max(m,n)), where 
𝑚
m and

n are the lengths of the two linked lists. This is because we are traversing each list once.

O(max(m,n)) for the resulting linked list, as we are creating new nodes for each sum.
This approach efficiently handles the addition of two numbers represented by linked lists and adheres to the constraints provided.
