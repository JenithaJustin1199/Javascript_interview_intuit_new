To solve the "Permutations" problem, we can use a backtracking approach. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

Approach
Backtracking:

We will build each permutation by choosing one element at a time, removing it from the available pool, and then recursively calling the function to build the rest of the permutation.
After we complete a permutation, we’ll backtrack by restoring the element we removed so that we can explore other possibilities.
Base Case:

When the current permutation being built reaches the length of the nums array, we add it to our list of results.
Recursive Function:

For each number in nums, if it has not been used in the current permutation path, we add it to the path and call the function recursively to continue building the permutation.
After each recursive call, we backtrack by removing the last added element, allowing us to use it in different orders.
Termination:

This will generate all unique permutations since we only consider unused elements each time.
Implementation in JavaScript
Here’s how to implement this in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
function permute(nums) {
    const result = [];
    
    function backtrack(path, used) {
        // Base case: if the path length equals nums length, add to result
        if (path.length === nums.length) {
            result.push([...path]);
            return;
        }
        
        // Try each number in nums
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (used[i]) continue; // Skip if already used
            
            // Add nums[i] to the path
            path.push(nums[i]);
            used[i] = true; // Mark as used
            
            // Recurse to build the rest of the permutation
            backtrack(path, used);
            
            // Backtrack: remove the last element and mark as unused
            path.pop();
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }
    
    backtrack([], Array(nums.length).fill(false)); // Start with an empty path and unused nums
    return result;
}

// Example usage
console.log(permute([1,2,3])); // Output: [[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]
console.log(permute([0,1]));   // Output: [[0,1], [1,0]]
console.log(permute([1]));     // Output: [[1]]
Explanation of the Code
Result Array: result holds all the permutations.
Backtracking Function:
backtrack(path, used) is a recursive helper that builds each permutation.
path stores the current sequence being constructed.
used is a boolean array that marks which elements in nums are already in path.
Building Permutations:
We iterate over each number in nums. If it’s not used in the current path, we:
Add it to the path.
Mark it as used.
Recur to build the next part of the permutation.
After recursion, we backtrack by removing the last element and unmarking it, allowing other sequences.
