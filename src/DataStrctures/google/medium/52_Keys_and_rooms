The "Keys and Rooms" problem is a classic graph traversal challenge where we have to determine if we can visit all rooms in a given structure. Here’s a breakdown of the problem and how to solve it.

Problem Explanation
Rooms and Keys: You have n rooms, each identified by a number from 0 to n-1. All rooms are locked except for room 0, which you can access immediately.
Keys: Each room contains a list of keys that can unlock other rooms. For instance, if you visit room i, you might find keys for rooms j, k, etc.
Goal: The goal is to determine if you can visit all rooms starting from room 0 using the keys you collect.
Key Insights
Graph Representation: The rooms and keys can be visualized as a directed graph where:

Each room is a node.
An edge from room i to room j exists if room i contains a key for room j.
Traversal Strategy: To determine if all rooms can be visited, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Visited Tracking: We need to keep track of which rooms we have already visited to avoid cycles and ensure we don’t visit the same room multiple times.

Solution Using Depth-First Search (DFS)
Here’s a solution using DFS to traverse the rooms:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {number[][]} rooms
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canVisitAllRooms = function(rooms) {
    const visited = new Array(rooms.length).fill(false); // Track visited rooms
    const stack = [0]; // Start DFS from room 0
    visited[0] = true; // Mark room 0 as visited

    // Step 1: Perform DFS
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        const room = stack.pop(); // Get the current room
        for (const key of rooms[room]) { // Iterate through keys found in this room
            if (!visited[key]) { // If we haven't visited this room
                visited[key] = true; // Mark it as visited
                stack.push(key); // Add it to the stack to explore later
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Check if all rooms have been visited
    for (let i = 0; i < rooms.length; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            return false; // If any room is not visited, return false
        }
    }
    return true; // All rooms visited
};

// Example usage
console.log(canVisitAllRooms([[1],[2],[3],[]])); // Output: true
console.log(canVisitAllRooms([[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]])); // Output: false
Explanation of the Code
Initialization:

A visited array is created to track which rooms have been visited.
A stack is initialized with room 0, which is the starting point.
DFS Loop:

The loop continues until there are no more rooms to visit (i.e., the stack is empty).
For the current room popped from the stack, we iterate through the keys (the rooms it unlocks).
If a room can be accessed (not yet visited), we mark it as visited and add it to the stack.
Final Check:

After the DFS completes, we check if all rooms have been visited by iterating through the visited array.
If any room remains unvisited, we return false. Otherwise, we return true.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑉
+
𝐸
)
O(V+E), where 
𝑉
V is the number of rooms (nodes), and 
𝐸
E is the total number of keys (edges). Since each room and key is processed at most once, the traversal is efficient.

Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑉
)
O(V) due to the visited array and the stack used for the DFS traversal.

This approach ensures that you can efficiently determine if all rooms can be accessed given the keys found within them!
