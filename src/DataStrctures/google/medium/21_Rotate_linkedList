To solve this problem efficiently with minimal time and space complexity, we need to handle the rotation without creating additional linked list structures. Here’s an optimal approach:

Approach
Calculate the Length of the List:

Traverse the linked list to get its length. While doing this, connect the tail node to the head, temporarily creating a circular linked list. This allows us to "rotate" by moving to the correct node directly.
Compute the Effective Rotations:

Since rotating the list by its length results in the same list, we can use k % length to find the actual number of rotations needed.
Find the New Tail and New Head:

The new tail of the rotated list will be at position length - k % length - 1 from the start, and the new head will be the node right after the new tail.
Break the Circular Connection:

Disconnect the circular connection by setting the next pointer of the new tail node to null.
Code Implementation
Here's the efficient solution:

javascript
Copy code
var rotateRight = function(head, k) {
    if (!head || k === 0) return head;

    // Step 1: Find the length of the list and make it circular
    let length = 1;
    let tail = head;
    while (tail.next) {
        tail = tail.next;
        length++;
    }
    // Connect tail to head to make it circular
    tail.next = head;

    // Step 2: Compute the effective rotations needed
    k = k % length;
    if (k === 0) {
        tail.next = null; // Break the circle before returning
        return head;
    }

    // Step 3: Find the new tail at (length - k - 1) and new head at (length - k)
    let newTail = head;
    for (let i = 0; i < length - k - 1; i++) {
        newTail = newTail.next;
    }
    let newHead = newTail.next;

    // Step 4: Break the circle
    newTail.next = null;

    return newHead;
};
Explanation of Complexity
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) where 
𝑛
n is the number of nodes in the list. We traverse the list once to get the length, and then we traverse a part of it again to find the new tail.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1), as we use only a few pointers without additional data structures.
Example Walkthrough
For head = [1,2,3,4,5] and k = 2:

Length Calculation: The list length is 5.
Effective Rotation: k % 5 = 2, so we need 2 rotations.
Find New Tail: The new tail is at position 5 - 2 - 1 = 2 (0-based), which is node 3.
New Head and Break: The new head becomes 4, and we break the link at node 3.
The resulting list is [4,5,1,2,3], as expected.
