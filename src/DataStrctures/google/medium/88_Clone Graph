Your implementation of the graph cloning function is almost correct, but there are a couple of small issues that need to be addressed. Here's a breakdown of the corrections:

Issues in Your Code
Property Access Error:

You are accessing current.value instead of current.val. Since the _Node constructor defines the value of a node as this.val, you should access it using current.val.
Use of new Node:

Ensure you use new _Node() instead of new Node() when creating a cloned node. This is important because the function is defined to use _Node.
Corrected Code
Here's the revised version of your code:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * // Definition for a _Node.
 * function _Node(val, neighbors) {
 *    this.val = val === undefined ? 0 : val;
 *    this.neighbors = neighbors === undefined ? [] : neighbors;
 * };
 */

/**
 * @param {_Node} node
 * @return {_Node}
 */
var cloneGraph = function(node) {
    if (!node) return null; // Handle the case for an empty graph

    let visited = new Map(); // Map to keep track of visited nodes

    function dfs(current) {
        // Check if the current node has already been cloned
        if (visited.has(current)) {
            return visited.get(current);
        }

        // Create a clone of the current node
        const clonedNode = new _Node(current.val); // Correctly use current.val
        visited.set(current, clonedNode); // Map the original node to the cloned node

        // Recursively clone the neighbors
        for (let neighbor of current.neighbors) {
            clonedNode.neighbors.push(dfs(neighbor));
        }
        return clonedNode; // Return the cloned node
    }

    return dfs(node); // Start DFS from the given node
};
Summary of Changes
Access Correct Property: Changed current.value to current.val to correctly reference the value of the node.
Clone Creation: Used new _Node(current.val) to create a clone of the node.
Explanation of the Code
DFS Approach: The function uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph.
Visited Map: A Map is used to keep track of cloned nodes to avoid duplicating the cloning process for the same node.
Base Case: If the input node is null, the function immediately returns null.
Neighbor Cloning: It recursively clones each neighbor of the current node and adds it to the cloned node's neighbors.
With these corrections, your code should work correctly to clone a graph. If you have any further questions or need more help, feel free to ask!
