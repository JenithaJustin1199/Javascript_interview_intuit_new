Certainly! The problem of finding unique combinations that sum up to a target can be solved using a backtracking approach. In this method, we will explore all possible combinations of the candidates by recursively building them and keeping track of the current sum.

Approach:
Backtracking Function: We will create a helper function that will:

Take the current combination, the remaining target, and the starting index as parameters.
If the remaining target is zero, we have found a valid combination, and we can add it to our results.
If the remaining target is negative, we stop the exploration as we've exceeded the target.
Iterate through the candidates starting from the given index (to allow repeated usage of the same candidate) and recursively call the function, subtracting the candidate value from the remaining target.
Avoid Duplicates: Since the input array is guaranteed to contain distinct integers, we do not need to handle duplicate combinations by explicitly sorting or checking frequencies.

Base Cases: Handle cases where the target is less than the smallest candidate by returning an empty array.

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the above approach in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
var combinationSum = function(candidates, target) {
    const results = [];

    function backtrack(combination, remaining, start) {
        // If the remaining target is zero, we found a valid combination
        if (remaining === 0) {
            results.push([...combination]); // Add a copy of the combination
            return;
        }

        // If the remaining target is less than zero, return as no valid combination can be formed
        if (remaining < 0) {
            return;
        }

        // Iterate through the candidates starting from 'start' index
        for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            combination.push(candidates[i]); // Choose the candidate
            backtrack(combination, remaining - candidates[i], i); // Recur with updated values
            combination.pop(); // Backtrack: remove the last chosen candidate
        }
    }

    backtrack([], target, 0); // Start the backtracking process
    return results; // Return all valid combinations
};

// Example usage:
console.log(combinationSum([2, 3, 6, 7], 7)); // Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
console.log(combinationSum([2, 3, 5], 8));    // Output: [[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]
console.log(combinationSum([2], 1));           // Output: []
Explanation of the Code:
Initialization: We define a function combinationSum that initializes the results array and starts the backtracking process.

Backtrack Function:

Base Case (Valid Combination): If the remaining target reaches zero, the current combination is valid and is added to the results.
Base Case (Exceeded Target): If the remaining target is negative, we simply return.
Iterating through Candidates: We loop through the candidates, pushing the current candidate into the combination and calling backtrack recursively. After returning from the recursion, we pop the candidate to try the next one.
Final Output: After the backtracking completes, we return the list of valid combinations.

Time Complexity:
The time complexity can vary depending on the input but is generally exponential due to the recursive nature of the problem.
