To solve the problem of finding the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree, we can use a recursive approach. The main idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root and check for the presence of the two nodes (p and q).

Key Steps in the Algorithm
Base Case: If the current node is null, we return null. If the current node matches either p or q, we return that node.

Recursive Traversal: We recursively call the function on the left and right children of the current node.

Determine LCA: After the recursive calls, we check:

If both the left and right calls return non-null values, it means that p is found in one subtree and q in the other, which indicates that the current node is their LCA.
If only one of the calls returns a non-null value, we propagate that non-null node up the tree.
Return the Result: Finally, the function will return the LCA node when both p and q are found.

JavaScript Implementation
Here‚Äôs how you can implement the above logic in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = this.right = null;
    }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q) {
    // Base case: if the root is null or matches p or q
    if (root === null || root === p || root === q) {
        return root;
    }

    // Recursively search for p and q in the left and right subtrees
    const left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
    const right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    // If both left and right are non-null, root is the LCA
    if (left !== null && right !== null) {
        return root;
    }

    // Otherwise, return the non-null child (either left or right)
    return left !== null ? left : right;
}

// Example usage:
const root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(5);
root.right = new TreeNode(1);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(6);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
root.left.right.left = new TreeNode(7);
root.left.right.right = new TreeNode(4);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(0);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(8);

const p = root.left; // Node with value 5
const q = root.right; // Node with value 1

console.log(lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q).val); // Output: 3
Explanation of the Code
TreeNode Class: This defines the structure of a tree node with a value and pointers to left and right children.

Function lowestCommonAncestor:

Base Cases: The function checks if the root is null or if it matches either p or q. If so, it returns root.
Recursive Calls: It calls itself for the left and right children of the current node.
LCA Determination: It checks if both left and right calls returned non-null values. If they did, the current node is the LCA. Otherwise, it returns the non-null result.

This algorithm effectively finds the LCA for two nodes in a binary tree while being efficient and clear in its implementation.

To find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, we can follow these steps:

Use a Queue: We'll employ a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree. This will help us explore nodes level by level.

Parent Mapping: We'll create a mapping of each node to its parent. This will allow us to backtrack from the nodes p and q to find their LCA.

Finding the LCA:

Start BFS from the root, recording the parent of each node in the mapping.
Once we've built the parent mapping, backtrack from both p and q, marking the ancestors of p.
Then, traverse from q until we find the first ancestor that is also an ancestor of p. This will be the LCA.
JavaScript Implementation
Here‚Äôs how you can implement this using BFS:

javascript
Copy code
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = this.right = null;
    }
}

function lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q) {
    if (!root) return null;

    // Map to store parent pointers
    const parent = new Map();
    const queue = [root];
    
    // Perform BFS to populate the parent map
    while (queue.length) {
        const node = queue.shift();

        // Set the parent of the left child
        if (node.left) {
            parent.set(node.left, node);
            queue.push(node.left);
        }

        // Set the parent of the right child
        if (node.right) {
            parent.set(node.right, node);
            queue.push(node.right);
        }
    }

    // Set to track the ancestors of p
    const ancestors = new Set();
    
    // Backtrack from p and record its ancestors
    while (p) {
        ancestors.add(p);
        p = parent.get(p);
    }

    // Backtrack from q and find the first common ancestor
    while (!ancestors.has(q)) {
        q = parent.get(q);
    }

    return q; // q is now the LCA of the original p and q
}

// Example usage:
const root = new TreeNode(3);
root.left = new TreeNode(5);
root.right = new TreeNode(1);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(6);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
root.left.right.left = new TreeNode(7);
root.left.right.right = new TreeNode(4);
root.right.left = new TreeNode(0);
root.right.right = new TreeNode(8);

const p = root.left; // Node with value 5
const q = root.right; // Node with value 1

console.log(lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q).val); // Output: 3
Explanation of the Code
TreeNode Class: Defines the structure of a tree node.

Function lowestCommonAncestor:

Parent Mapping: We initialize a Map to store each node's parent and a queue for BFS.
BFS Loop: We iterate through each node, enqueueing its children and populating the parent mapping.
Tracking Ancestors: We backtrack from node p, adding each ancestor to a Set.
Finding LCA: We then backtrack from node q, checking if the ancestor is in the Set. The first common ancestor found is the LCA.

This BFS approach provides an effective way to find the LCA of two nodes in a binary tree.
