This problem is known as the "Coin Change Problem." We aim to determine the minimum number of coins needed to reach a specified amount using denominations provided in an array.

Assumptions
coins is an array of positive integers where each element represents a coin denomination.
amount is a non-negative integer representing the target amount.
If it's impossible to reach the exact amount using the coins, return -1.
Solution Approaches
Approach 1: Dynamic Programming with Minimum Coins (Optimal Time Complexity)
This is a common approach for minimizing values in such "minimum/maximum" type problems. We will use a dynamic programming array dp where dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins required to make up the amount i.

DP Array Setup:

Create an array dp of size amount + 1 where each element is initialized to Infinity, except dp[0] which is set to 0 (no coins are needed for zero amount).
DP Transition:

For each coin in coins, and for each sub-amount from coin to amount:
Update dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1).
If dp[i - coin] is valid (not Infinity), this means we can use the coin to reach the amount i with fewer coins.
Result Calculation:

After filling the dp array, dp[amount] will contain the minimum number of coins needed to reach amount. If dp[amount] is still Infinity, return -1 (indicating it's impossible to reach the exact amount).
Here’s the JavaScript code:

javascript
Copy code
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    const dp = Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }

    return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑁
×
𝑀
)
O(N×M), where 
𝑁
N is the number of coins and 
𝑀
M is the amount.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑀
)
O(M), as we only use an array of size amount + 1.

Approach 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Minimal Coins (Alternative for Large Coin Sets)
A BFS approach can also work here, where we treat each amount as a "node" and each coin as an "edge" in a graph traversal.

BFS Initialization:

Initialize a queue with the pair (0, 0) representing (currentAmount, coinCount).
Use a Set to track visited amounts and avoid reprocessing the same amount multiple times.
BFS Traversal:

For each currentAmount, try adding each coin:
If currentAmount + coin equals amount, return the coinCount + 1.
If currentAmount + coin < amount and hasn’t been visited, enqueue (currentAmount + coin, coinCount + 1) and mark it as visited.
If the queue is exhausted without reaching amount, return -1.
Here’s the JavaScript code:

javascript
Copy code
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    if (amount === 0) return 0;

    const queue = [[0, 0]]; // [currentAmount, coinCount]
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(0);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [currentAmount, coinCount] = queue.shift();

        for (let coin of coins) {
            const nextAmount = currentAmount + coin;

            if (nextAmount === amount) return coinCount + 1;
            if (nextAmount < amount && !visited.has(nextAmount)) {
                queue.push([nextAmount, coinCount + 1]);
                visited.add(nextAmount);
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑁
×
𝑀
)
O(N×M), where 
𝑁
N is the number of coins and 
𝑀
M is the amount (worst case).
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑀
)
O(M), due to the queue and visited set.

Approach 3: Recursive Solution with Memoization (Simpler Code Complexity)
This approach uses a top-down recursive method with memoization to store intermediate results. This is not as efficient as the DP approach but can be useful for smaller input sizes or cases requiring memoization.

Recursive Function with Memoization:

Define a recursive function minCoins that takes the remaining amount and returns the minimum coins needed to make up that amount.
If amount is zero, return zero. If it’s negative, return Infinity (indicating it’s not possible).
If the result is already calculated for amount, return it from memo.
Recursive Transition:

For each coin, call minCoins(amount - coin) and take the minimum result among all coins, adding 1 for the current coin.
Store the result in memo to avoid redundant calculations.
Result Calculation:

If the result from minCoins for the initial amount is Infinity, return -1. Otherwise, return the result.
Here’s the JavaScript code:

javascript
Copy code
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    const memo = new Map();

    function minCoins(remaining) {
        if (remaining === 0) return 0;
        if (remaining < 0) return Infinity;
        if (memo.has(remaining)) return memo.get(remaining);

        let minCount = Infinity;
        for (let coin of coins) {
            const count = minCoins(remaining - coin);
            if (count !== Infinity) {
                minCount = Math.min(minCount, count + 1);
            }
        }

        memo.set(remaining, minCount);
        return minCount;
    }

    const result = minCoins(amount);
    return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
}
Time Complexity: Exponential without memoization, reduced to 
𝑂
(
𝑁
×
𝑀
)
O(N×M) with memoization.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑀
)
O(M), because of recursion depth and memoization.

Comparison of Approaches
Approach 1 (DP): Optimal for time complexity and memory efficiency for large amount values.
Approach 2 (BFS): Useful for finding the shortest path in terms of "steps" (coins), though may have higher runtime for large amounts.
Approach 3 (Recursion with Memoization): Simplified in terms of code complexity but not as efficient for large inputs.
Recommended Approach: Approach 1 (DP) is usually the best choice for performance and reliability, especially for large input sizes.
