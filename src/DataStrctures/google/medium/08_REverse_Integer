Yes, let's solve the problem step by step. The task is to reverse the digits of a given signed 32-bit integer x while making sure that the reversed value stays within the 32-bit signed integer range. The 32-bit signed integer range is from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1, which is from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

Approach:
Handle the sign: If x is negative, handle it separately by converting it to its absolute value, reversing the digits, and then adding the negative sign back at the end.
Reverse the digits: Convert the integer to a string, reverse the string, and then convert it back to an integer.
Check for overflow: After reversing, if the result is outside the 32-bit signed integer range, return 0.
Edge cases: Handle cases where x is 0, or a number with trailing zeros like 120.
Solution in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @return {number}
 */
var reverse = function(x) {
    // Define the 32-bit signed integer range
    const MIN = -Math.pow(2, 31);
    const MAX = Math.pow(2, 31) - 1;
    
    // Get the absolute value of x and reverse its digits
    let reversed = parseInt(Math.abs(x).toString().split('').reverse().join(''));
    
    // Restore the negative sign if x is negative
    if (x < 0) {
        reversed = -reversed;
    }
    
    // Check if the reversed number is within the 32-bit integer range
    if (reversed < MIN || reversed > MAX) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    return reversed;
};
Explanation:
32-bit integer range: We define the minimum and maximum values for 32-bit integers, MIN = -2147483648 and MAX = 2147483647.

Absolute and reverse: Convert the absolute value of the number x to a string, split it into individual characters, reverse the array, and join it back together to get the reversed number as a string. Convert the string back to an integer using parseInt.

Negative numbers: If x was negative, we restore the negative sign by multiplying the reversed number by -1.

Overflow check: After reversing, we check if the result is within the 32-bit integer range. If it's outside, return 0.

Time Complexity:
O(n) where n is the number of digits in x. Reversing the digits involves converting the number to a string, reversing the string, and converting it back, which is linear in the number of digits.
Space Complexity:
O(n) for the space required to store the string representation of x and the reversed result.
Example Walkthroughs:
Example 1:

Input: x = 123
Reverse the digits: 321
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Reverse the digits: 321
Restore negative sign: -321
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Reverse the digits: 021 (which is 21)
Output: 21
This solution ensures that the reversed integer stays within the 32-bit range and handles all edge cases efficiently.
