To solve the problem of finding the intersection of two lists of closed intervals, we need to calculate the overlapping intervals between these two sorted lists of intervals. Here’s a structured approach to tackle this problem.

Assumptions
Each interval in both lists is represented as [start, end].
Both lists are sorted in ascending order by the start time.
We want to find all intersecting intervals between the two lists.
Problem Breakdown and Observations
Two intervals, [a1, b1] from the first list and [a2, b2] from the second list, intersect if:
a1 <= b2 and a2 <= b1 (i.e., there is an overlap).
The intersection interval would be:
[max(a1, a2), min(b1, b2)].
Solution Approach
This problem can be efficiently solved using a two-pointer approach, which allows us to iterate through both lists with minimal complexity.

Approach 1: Two-Pointer Technique (Optimal)
This approach leverages the fact that the intervals are sorted. We use two pointers to traverse each interval list, i for the first interval list and j for the second interval list.

Initialize two pointers: i = 0 for the first interval list and j = 0 for the second interval list.
Iterate through both lists:
For each pair of intervals interval1 = [a1, b1] from the first list and interval2 = [a2, b2] from the second list:
Check if they intersect:
If a1 <= b2 and a2 <= b1, they intersect.
Calculate the intersection interval as [max(a1, a2), min(b1, b2)] and add it to the result list.
Move the pointer for the interval that ends first:
If b1 < b2, increment i to consider the next interval in the first list.
Otherwise, increment j to consider the next interval in the second list.
End Condition: Continue until either pointer reaches the end of its respective list.
Here’s the JavaScript code implementing this approach:

javascript
Copy code
function intervalIntersection(firstList, secondList) {
    let i = 0, j = 0;
    const intersections = [];

    while (i < firstList.length && j < secondList.length) {
        const [a1, b1] = firstList[i];
        const [a2, b2] = secondList[j];

        // Check for intersection
        if (a1 <= b2 && a2 <= b1) {
            intersections.push([Math.max(a1, a2), Math.min(b1, b2)]);
        }

        // Move the pointer for the interval that ends first
        if (b1 < b2) {
            i++;
        } else {
            j++;
        }
    }

    return intersections;
}
Explanation and Complexity
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑁
+
𝑀
)
O(N+M), where 
𝑁
N is the length of the first list and 
𝑀
M is the length of the second list. Each interval is processed at most once, making this approach efficient.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝐾
)
O(K), where 
𝐾
K is the number of intersecting intervals.
Approach 2: Brute Force (Higher Time Complexity)
A brute force approach would involve iterating over each interval in the first list and checking for intersections with each interval in the second list.

For each interval interval1 in the first list, iterate through all intervals interval2 in the second list.
Check if they intersect and store the intersection if they do.
JavaScript Code for Brute Force:

javascript
Copy code
function intervalIntersection(firstList, secondList) {
    const intersections = [];

    for (let interval1 of firstList) {
        for (let interval2 of secondList) {
            const [a1, b1] = interval1;
            const [a2, b2] = interval2;

            if (a1 <= b2 && a2 <= b1) {
                intersections.push([Math.max(a1, a2), Math.min(b1, b2)]);
            }
        }
    }

    return intersections;
}
Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑁
×
𝑀
)
O(N×M), which is less efficient and unsuitable for large lists.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝐾
)
O(K).
Comparison and Recommendation
Optimal Solution (Two-Pointer): This approach is efficient in terms of both time and space, making it suitable for large interval lists. It leverages sorting and minimizes the number of comparisons.
Brute Force: This approach is more straightforward but inefficient for large inputs due to the nested iteration.
Recommended Solution: The two-pointer approach is optimal and recommended for performance. It effectively reduces the time complexity by utilizing the sorted order of intervals.
