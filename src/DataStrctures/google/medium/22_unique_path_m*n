To solve the "Unique Paths" problem efficiently, we can approach it using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is that the number of ways to reach any cell is the sum of the ways to reach the cell directly above it and the cell directly to its left. Here's how we can do it:

Approach:
Grid Setup: Create a 2D DP array dp[m][n] where each entry dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to reach cell (i, j) from (0, 0).
Base Case: There is only one way to reach any cell in the first row (move only right), and there is only one way to reach any cell in the first column (move only down). Thus, all entries in the first row and first column are set to 1.
Recurrence Relation: For every other cell (i, j), the number of ways to reach it is the sum of the ways to reach the cell directly above it (dp[i-1][j]) and the cell directly to its left (dp[i][j-1]):

dp[i][j]=dp[i−1][j]+dp[i][j−1]
Result: The value at dp[m-1][n-1] will give the total number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

    // Initialize a 1D DP array of size 'n' filled with 1
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(1);

    // Iterate over rows starting from the second one
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        // For each row, update the dp array
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1]; // Update current cell
        }
    }

    // The last element contains the number of unique paths
    return dp[n - 1];
};
Explanation:
We initialize a 1D array dp of size n (number of columns) filled with 1 because there is only one way to get to any cell in the first row.
Then, we iterate through the rows and for each cell in the current row, we update the dp[j] using the formula dp[j] = dp[j] + dp[j - 1].
dp[j] stores the number of ways to reach the current cell in the current row.
dp[j-1] is the number of ways from the left cell, and dp[j] is the number of ways from the top.
Finally, after all iterations, dp[n-1] holds the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner.
Example Walkthrough:
For m = 3, n = 7:

Initially, dp = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
After processing the second row, dp = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
After processing the third row, dp = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28].
The final answer is 28, which is stored in dp[6].
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑚
×
𝑛
)
O(m×n) because we are iterating over every cell in the grid.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) since we are only using a 1D array of size n to store the intermediate results.
This solution is efficient and works well even for larger values of m and n.
