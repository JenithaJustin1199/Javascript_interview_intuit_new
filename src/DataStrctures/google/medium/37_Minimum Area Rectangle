To solve the Minimum Area Rectangle problem efficiently, we can use a hash set for quick lookup of points and identify pairs of points that could form the diagonal of a rectangle. Here’s a breakdown of the optimized approach:

Problem Breakdown and Approach
Identify Rectangle Formation:

To form a rectangle with sides parallel to the X and Y axes, we need two pairs of points that can serve as the diagonally opposite corners. For example, if (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are diagonal points, then the other two points needed to form a rectangle would be (x1, y2) and (x2, y1).
Hash Set for Fast Lookup:

To quickly check if the necessary points for rectangle formation exist, store each point in a set. This allows 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) time complexity for lookups.
Iterate and Find Minimum Area:

For each pair of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2):
Check if they can form a rectangle diagonal by ensuring x1 != x2 and y1 != y2 (to avoid collinear points).
If they satisfy this, check if the other two points (x1, y2) and (x2, y1) exist in the set.
If they do, calculate the area of the rectangle formed, which would be |x2 - x1| * |y2 - y1|.
Track the minimum area found across all valid rectangles.
Return the Result:

If no rectangle is found, return 0. Otherwise, return the minimum area found.
Here's the JavaScript solution for the Minimum Area Rectangle problem:

javascript
Copy code
function minAreaRect(points) {
    const pointSet = new Set(points.map(([x, y]) => `${x},${y}`));
    let minArea = Infinity;

    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
            const [x1, y1] = points[i];
            const [x2, y2] = points[j];

            // Check if (x1, y2) and (x2, y1) form a valid rectangle diagonal
            if (x1 !== x2 && y1 !== y2) {
                if (pointSet.has(`${x1},${y2}`) && pointSet.has(`${x2},${y1}`)) {
                    const area = Math.abs(x2 - x1) * Math.abs(y2 - y1);
                    minArea = Math.min(minArea, area);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return minArea === Infinity ? 0 : minArea;
}
Explanation
Point Set:

Each point [x, y] is stored as a string x,y in a set for 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) lookup.
Nested Loop for Pairs:

For each pair of points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), we check if they could form a diagonal of a rectangle.
Rectangle Check and Area Calculation:

If the necessary diagonal points (x1, y2) and (x2, y1) are in the set, we calculate the area.
minArea tracks the smallest rectangle found.
Result:

If minArea is unchanged, return 0 (no rectangle found); otherwise, return minArea.

For this solution to the Minimum Area Rectangle problem, here’s the time and space complexity analysis:

Time Complexity
Nested Loop Over Points: The algorithm has two nested loops over the points array, so the base complexity here is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ), where 
𝑛
n is the number of points.
Set Lookup: Checking if two points form a valid rectangle involves checking for two other points in the pointSet, which is an 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) operation per lookup.
Overall Complexity: As each pair of points is checked for forming a rectangle, the total time complexity is:
𝑂
(
𝑛

)
O(n 
2
 )
Space Complexity
Point Set: The pointSet stores each point, so the space complexity for the set is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of points.
Auxiliary Space: There are no other major data structures being used apart from the set.
