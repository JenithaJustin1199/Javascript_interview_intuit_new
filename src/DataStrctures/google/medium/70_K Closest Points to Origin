To solve the "K Closest Points to Origin" problem efficiently, we can use a max-heap (priority queue) approach to keep track of the k closest points. The max-heap will help us ensure that, at any point, we only have the k closest points by comparing the squared Euclidean distance of each point to the origin.

Since MaxPriorityQueue may not be available in all JavaScript environments, we can use an array-based approach where we sort and maintain a list of the closest points, as explained in the previous answer. But for environments that support MinHeap or MaxHeap, here’s a quick solution using Array.sort for simplicity.

Solution Using Sorting (Simpler but Not Optimal for Large Inputs)
Calculate the squared distance for each point to avoid the overhead of computing the square root.
Sort the points based on their distance to the origin.
Return the first k points from the sorted list.
Here's the JavaScript solution:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var kClosest = function(points, k) {
    // Calculate the distance squared for each point and sort by it
    points.sort((a, b) => (a[0] ** 2 + a[1] ** 2) - (b[0] ** 2 + b[1] ** 2));
    
    // Return the first k points from the sorted array
    return points.slice(0, k);
};
Explanation
Sorting: Array.sort is used to sort the points based on their squared Euclidean distance, which has a time complexity of 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn).
Return: We then take the first k points, which are the closest ones after sorting.
Time Complexity
The sorting operation takes 
𝑂
(

)
O(nlogn), which is efficient for moderately sized inputs.
Space Complexity
The space complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where n is the number of points, due to the storage of the points array.
Solution Using Heap (More Optimal for Large n)
If we have a large number of points (n), a max-heap approach with size k would be optimal. Here’s a solution with a priority queue if available or via a custom max-heap structure to keep the solution at 
𝑂
(
𝑛

O(nlogk) for larger inputs.
