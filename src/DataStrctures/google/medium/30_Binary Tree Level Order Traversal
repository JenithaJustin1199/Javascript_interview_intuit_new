To solve the Binary Tree Level Order Traversal efficiently, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, utilizing a queue data structure. This approach allows us to traverse each level of the tree and collect node values level-by-level.

Here's a step-by-step solution with an optimal approach:

Approach
Use a Queue: Initialize a queue with the root node. The queue will help us process each level of the tree one by one.
Process Each Level Separately: For each level, we:
Record the number of nodes at that level (i.e., the current queue size).
Use a loop to dequeue nodes at that level and add their values to a temporary list.
Enqueue the left and right children of each node (if they exist).
Add Each Level's Nodes to the Result: Once all nodes at a level are processed, add the temporary list for that level to the final result list.
Return the Result: After processing all levels, return the result list.
Time Complexity
O(N): Each node is processed once.
Space Complexity
O(N): The queue may store all nodes at the largest level of the tree (worst case).

Copy code
var levelOrder = function(root) {
    if (!root) return [];
    
    let result = [];
    let queue = [root];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSize = queue.length;
        let levelNodes = [];
        
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            let node = queue.shift();
            levelNodes.push(node.val);
            
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
        
        result.push(levelNodes);
    }
    
    return result;
};
Explanation
Edge Case Check: If the root is null, we return an empty list as there are no levels to traverse.
Loop Through Each Level:
For each level, we:
Record the number of nodes in the queue (the current level size).
For each node at this level, dequeue it, add its value to the levelNodes list, and enqueue its children.
After processing all nodes at a level, we add levelNodes to the result.
This BFS approach ensures that nodes are processed level-by-level, and the solution is both time- and space-efficient.
