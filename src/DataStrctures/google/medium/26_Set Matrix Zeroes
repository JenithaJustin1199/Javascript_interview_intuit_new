To solve the "Set Matrix Zeroes" problem efficiently with in-place modification, we can utilize constant space beyond the input matrix by using the first row and first column as markers. Here’s a breakdown of the approach:

Approach:
Identify Rows and Columns to be Zeroed:

Traverse through the matrix to find elements that are zero.
Instead of using extra space to track rows and columns that should be zeroed, use the first row and first column of the matrix as markers:
If matrix[i][j] is 0, set matrix[i][0] and matrix[0][j] to 0 to indicate that row i and column j should be zeroed later.
Edge Case for First Row and Column:

To avoid affecting the first row and first column immediately, keep a separate flag (boolean) to determine if the first row and first column need to be zeroed based on whether any element in those positions is zero.
Set Inner Matrix Zeroes:

Starting from the second row and second column, zero out each row or column based on the markers in the first row and column.
Set the First Row and First Column:

Finally, based on the initial flags, zero out the first row and first column if needed.
Code Implementation:
javascript
Copy code
var setZeroes = function(matrix) {
    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    let firstRowZero = false;
    let firstColZero = false;

    // Step 1: Determine which rows and columns need to be zeroed
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === 0) {
                if (i === 0) firstRowZero = true;
                if (j === 0) firstColZero = true;
                matrix[i][0] = 0;
                matrix[0][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Zero out cells based on markers in the first row and column
    for (let i = 1; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < cols; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][0] === 0 || matrix[0][j] === 0) {
                matrix[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Zero out the first row if necessary
    if (firstRowZero) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            matrix[0][j] = 0;
        }
    }

    // Step 4: Zero out the first column if necessary
    if (firstColZero) {
        for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            matrix[i][0] = 0;
        }
    }
};
Explanation of Steps
Marking Rows and Columns: By marking the first row and first column, we efficiently track which rows and columns should be zeroed.
Zeroing Based on Markers: We start from the second row and column to prevent prematurely zeroing parts of the matrix.
Setting First Row and Column: Finally, based on whether any element in the initial scan was zero, we zero the first row and column.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑚
×
𝑛
)
O(m×n), where 
𝑚
m is the number of rows and 
𝑛
n is the number of columns. We iterate over each element of the matrix twice (once to mark and once to set zeroes).
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1), as no additional storage is used beyond the input matrix, and we rely on in-place markers.
This solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient while meeting the in-place requirement.
