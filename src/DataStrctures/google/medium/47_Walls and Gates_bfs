To solve the "Walls and Gates" problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is efficient for this problem because we need to propagate distances from multiple gates (cells with a value of 0) to their nearest empty rooms (cells with the value INF). This method is similar to the "Number of Islands" problem but uses BFS rather than DFS.

Approach
Initialization:

Identify the positions of all the gates (cells with value 0) in the grid. These will serve as our starting points for the BFS.
BFS for Distance Propagation:

Use a queue to perform a BFS. Start from each gate and explore its neighboring cells. If a neighboring cell is an empty room (with a value of INF), update its distance to be one more than the distance of the gate and add it to the queue for further exploration.
Direction Vectors:

Define the possible movements (up, down, left, right) to explore neighboring cells.
Continue Until All Cells are Processed:

The BFS will continue until all reachable empty rooms have been updated with their distance to the nearest gate.
Implementation
Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:
/**
 * @param {number[][]} rooms
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify rooms in-place instead.
 */
var wallsAndGates = function(rooms) {
    if (rooms.length === 0 || !rooms) return;

    let rows = rooms.length;
    let cols = rooms[0].length;
    let gateQueue = [];
    let directions = [[0,1], [1,0], [0,-1], [-1,0]];

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (rooms[i][j] === 0) {
                gateQueue.push([i, j]);
            }
        }
    }

    while (gateQueue.length > 0) {
        let [x, y] = gateQueue.shift();
        for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
            let nx = x + dx;
            let ny = y + dy;

            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < rows && ny < cols && rooms[nx][ny] === 2147483647) {
                rooms[nx][ny] = rooms[x][y] + 1;
                gateQueue.push([nx, ny]);
            }
        }
    }
};
Explanation of the Code
Initialization:

We check if the rooms grid is empty. If not, we define the grid dimensions and set up a queue.
Enqueue Gates:

We iterate through the grid and enqueue the positions of all gates.
BFS Loop:

The BFS continues until there are no more elements in the queue. For each gate, we check all four possible directions.
If an adjacent cell is an empty room (value INF), we update its value to be one more than the current gate's distance and enqueue it for further processing.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Each cell is processed at most once.

Space Complexity: O(m * n) in the worst case for the queue that could store all empty rooms if they were all adjacent to gates.

This BFS approach efficiently fills each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate.
