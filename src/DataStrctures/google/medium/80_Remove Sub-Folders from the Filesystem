To solve this problem, we can take advantage of sorting the folders lexicographically. This way, any sub-folder of a folder will be grouped next to its parent folder. After sorting, we can iterate through the folders and keep track of the root folders, filtering out any sub-folders that appear.

Approach:
Sort the folder list:

Sort the folders in lexicographical order. This ensures that if folder "/a" has sub-folders like "/a/b" or "/a/b/c", they will appear immediately after "/a" in the sorted list.
Use a loop to check for sub-folders:

Initialize an empty list result to store the root folders.
For each folder in the sorted list:
If it is not a sub-folder of the last folder in result, add it to result.
We determine whether the current folder is a sub-folder by checking if it starts with the last folder in result followed by a slash ("/").
Return the result:

After processing all folders, the result list will contain only the root folders.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(

O(nlogn+m), where 
𝑛
n is the number of folders (for sorting) and 
𝑚
m is the total number of characters in all folder names (for checking each folder).
Space Complexity:

O(n), as we store the resulting root folders in a list.
Solution Code:
Here’s the JavaScript solution:

javascript
Copy code
function removeSubfolders(folder) {
    // Sort folders lexicographically
    folder.sort();
    
    const result = [];
    
    for (const f of folder) {
        // If result is empty or the current folder is not a sub-folder of the last added folder
        if (result.length === 0 || !f.startsWith(result[result.length - 1] + '/')) {
            result.push(f);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
Explanation with Examples:
Example 1:
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Sorted: ["/a", "/a/b", "/c/d", "/c/d/e", "/c/f"]
Process:
"/a" → add to result
"/a/b" → skip, as it’s a sub-folder of "/a"
"/c/d" → add to result
"/c/d/e" → skip, as it’s a sub-folder of "/c/d"
"/c/f" → add to result
Output: ["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]
Example 2:
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Sorted: ["/a", "/a/b/c", "/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"] (all other folders are sub-folders of "/a")
Example 3:
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Sorted: ["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/d"] (no folders are sub-folders of each other)
This solution is efficient and handles large inputs well by reducing unnecessary checks for each folder’s sub-folder status.
