The most optimal approach for solving the "Maximal Square" problem is indeed through Dynamic Programming (DP). By analyzing the problem in terms of smaller subproblems, we can arrive at a DP formula that will help solve it efficiently.

Dynamic Programming Approach
DP Formula Derivation
Observation:

If a cell (i, j) in the matrix is a '1', it could potentially be the bottom-right corner of a square of ones.
To find the largest square ending at (i, j), we need to know the largest squares ending at cells (i-1, j), (i, j-1), and (i-1, j-1). These represent the top, left, and top-left diagonal neighbors of (i, j).
DP Formula:

Define dp[i][j] as the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at (i, j).
If matrix[i][j] is '1', then:

dp[i][j]=min(dp[i−1][j],dp[i][j−1],dp[i−1][j−1])+1
If matrix[i][j] is '0', then dp[i][j] = 0 (it cannot be part of any square of ones).
Explanation of Formula:

If matrix[i][j] is '1', the maximal square ending at (i, j) depends on the smallest square among its neighbors (top, left, and top-left diagonal).
Adding 1 allows us to extend the square at (i, j) by one side if all three neighbors can also form a square.
Base Case:

For cells in the first row or first column, dp[i][j] = 1 if matrix[i][j] == '1', since they cannot form a larger square beyond themselves.
Example Walkthrough
Let's take matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]] as an example:

Initialize dp as a 2D array of zeroes with the same dimensions as matrix.
Iterate over each cell, applying the formula if matrix[i][j] == '1'.
Start with dp[0][0] = 1 because matrix[0][0] == '1'.
Moving to dp[1][2], matrix[1][2] == '1', so dp[1][2] = min(dp[0][2], dp[1][1], dp[0][1]) + 1 = 1.
Continue until we compute dp[2][3] = 2, representing a 2x2 square.
The maximum value in dp gives the side length of the largest square, and squaring this value gives the area.

Code Implementation
Here’s the code for this DP solution:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {character[][]} matrix
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximalSquare = function(matrix) {
    if (!matrix.length || !matrix[0].length) return 0;

    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    let maxSide = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === '1') {
                if (i === 0 || j === 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], dp[i - 1][j - 1]) + 1;
                }
                maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxSide * maxSide;
};

This approach efficiently computes the maximal square area without needing to check all possible submatrices, achieving the required optimal complexity.
