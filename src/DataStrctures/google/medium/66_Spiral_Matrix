To solve the Spiral Matrix problem efficiently, we can use a boundary-tracking approach. By keeping track of the boundaries (top, bottom, left, and right) of the matrix, we can control the direction in which we traverse and collect elements in a spiral order without needing any additional memory for visited cells.

Approach
Initialize Boundaries:

Define four boundaries: top, bottom, left, and right for the matrix.
Set top and left to 0, bottom to m - 1 (last row), and right to n - 1 (last column).
Traverse in Spiral Order:

Move Right along the top boundary and increment top.
Move Down along the right boundary and decrement right.
Move Left along the bottom boundary and decrement bottom.
Move Up along the left boundary and increment left.
Repeat these steps in a cycle until the boundaries overlap (i.e., top > bottom or left > right).

Terminate when boundaries overlap:

As soon as top exceeds bottom or left exceeds right, stop the traversal.
This approach ensures we collect all elements in the matrix in a spiral order with O(m * n) time complexity, where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

Code Implementation
Here’s how this approach translates into JavaScript code:

javascript
Copy code
function spiralOrder(matrix) {
    const result = [];
    if (!matrix.length || !matrix[0].length) return result;

    let top = 0,
        bottom = matrix.length - 1,
        left = 0,
        right = matrix[0].length - 1;

    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Move right
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            result.push(matrix[top][i]);
        }
        top++;

        // Move down
        for (let i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            result.push(matrix[i][right]);
        }
        right--;

        // Move left, if we are still within boundaries
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (let i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                result.push(matrix[bottom][i]);
            }
            bottom--;
        }

        // Move up, if we are still within boundaries
        if (left <= right) {
            for (let i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                result.push(matrix[i][left]);
            }
            left++;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(spiralOrder([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]));
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
Explanation of Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(m * n), since we visit each element in the matrix exactly once.
Space Complexity: O(1) extra space if we exclude the result array, as we are only using constant space for the boundary markers (top, bottom, left, and right).
Advantages and Disadvantages
Advantages:

The boundary-tracking approach is straightforward and ensures each element is visited once, making it efficient.
Minimal additional space required, as it only uses boundary markers instead of an entire additional matrix for tracking.
Disadvantages:

Complexity can increase slightly if matrix boundaries aren’t handled correctly, especially for edge cases like a single row or column.
This is an optimal and simple approach to traverse any m x n matrix in spiral order.
