To solve the Decode String problem efficiently, we can utilize a stack-based approach to decode the string iteratively. The problem involves nested encoded strings in the form k[encoded_string], where k is the number of times the encoded_string should be repeated. This structure suggests that recursion or a stack is a natural fit for managing the nested nature of the problem.

Approach:
Stack for Multiplier and Encoded String:
Use a stack to keep track of both the current decoded string and the multiplier (k) whenever we encounter a new [.
Iterate through the String:
If we encounter a digit (k), calculate the full number (as the multiplier might have multiple digits).
If we encounter an opening bracket [, push the current decoded string and the multiplier onto the stack, then reset the current string and multiplier for the next encoded section.
If we encounter a closing bracket ], pop the last decoded string and multiplier from the stack, and append the current decoded string repeated k times to the previous decoded string.
If we encounter a letter, append it to the current decoded string.
Solution Code:
javascript
Copy code
var decodeString = function(s) {
    let stack = [];
    let currentString = "";
    let currentNum = 0;
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (!isNaN(char)) {
            // Build the number, as it can have multiple digits
            currentNum = currentNum * 10 + Number(char);
        } else if (char === '[') {
            // Push the current number and string to the stack
            stack.push([currentString, currentNum]);
            // Reset the current string and number for the new encoded section
            currentString = "";
            currentNum = 0;
        } else if (char === ']') {
            // Pop from the stack the last string and multiplier
            let [lastString, num] = stack.pop();
            // Repeat the current string num times and append to last string
            currentString = lastString + currentString.repeat(num);
        } else {
            // Normal characters, append to the current string
            currentString += char;
        }
    }
    
    return currentString;
};
Explanation of Code:
Initialization:

stack: This stack stores pairs [previousString, multiplier]. This helps us manage nested encodings.
currentString: Keeps track of the string being built.
currentNum: Accumulates the multiplier when digits are encountered.
Iterating through the String:

When encountering a digit, we multiply the currentNum by 10 and add the digit (char) to handle multi-digit numbers.
When encountering [, we push the currentString and currentNum onto the stack and reset them.
When encountering ], we pop from the stack and repeat the currentString based on the multiplier, appending it to the previous string.
For normal characters, we append them directly to the currentString.
Final Output:

At the end of the loop, currentString contains the fully decoded string.
Time Complexity:
O(n) where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once, and operations like string appending and multiplying are performed efficiently.
Space Complexity:
O(n) for the stack, where n is the length of the string. In the worst case, the stack will hold half the characters due to deeply nested encodings.
Example Walkthrough:
Example 1:
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"

Read 3, then [ → Push ["", 3] onto the stack.
Read a → Current string becomes "a".
Read ] → Pop from stack → ["", 3]. Append "aaa" to "". Now, currentString = "aaa".
Read 2, then [ → Push ["aaa", 2] onto the stack.
Read b, c → Current string becomes "bc".
Read ] → Pop from stack → ["aaa", 2]. Append "bcbc" to "aaa". Now, currentString = "aaabcbc".
Output: "aaabcbc"

Example 2:
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"

Read 3, then [ → Push ["", 3] onto the stack.
Read a → Current string becomes "a".
Read 2, then [ → Push ["a", 2] onto the stack.
Read c → Current string becomes "c".
Read ] → Pop from stack → ["a", 2]. Append "cc" to "a". Now, currentString = "acc".
Read ] → Pop from stack → ["", 3]. Append "accaccacc" to "". Now, currentString = "accaccacc".
Output: "accaccacc"

Example 3:
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"

Read 2, then [ → Push ["", 2] onto the stack.
Read abc → Current string becomes "abc".
Read ] → Pop from stack → ["", 2]. Append "abcabc" to "". Now, currentString = "abcabc".
Read 3, then [ → Push ["abcabc", 3] onto the stack.
Read cd → Current string becomes "cd".
Read ] → Pop from stack → ["abcabc", 3]. Append "cdcdcd" to "abcabc". Now, currentString = "abcabccdcdcd".
Read ef → Current string becomes "abcabccdcdcdef".
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"

This solution efficiently handles nested and repeated encodings, ensuring it adheres to the problem's constraints.
