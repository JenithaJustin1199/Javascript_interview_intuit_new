To solve the "Word Search" problem efficiently, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach with backtracking. This technique will allow us to explore all possible paths in the grid while pruning paths that don't match the given word. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

Approach
Iterate Over Each Cell: For each cell in the grid, check if it matches the first letter of the word. If it does, start a DFS from that cell.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Implement a recursive function that will:

Check if the current position matches the corresponding character in the word.
If all characters of the word are found, return true.
Mark the cell as visited (to prevent using the same letter twice).
Explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
After exploring, backtrack by unmarking the visited cell.
Base Cases:

If the current index exceeds the length of the word, return true.
If the current position is out of bounds or doesn't match the corresponding letter in the word, return false.
Search Pruning: If at any point the remaining characters of the word cannot be found based on the letters left in the grid, we can prune that path.

Implementation
Here’s how you can implement the above approach in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
var exist = function(board, word) {
    const m = board.length;
    const n = board[0].length;

    const dfs = (i, j, index) => {
        // If we have found all characters
        if (index === word.length) return true;

        // Check boundaries and character match
        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || board[i][j] !== word[index]) {
            return false;
        }

        // Mark the cell as visited
        const temp = board[i][j];
        board[i][j] = '#'; // Mark as visited with a special character

        // Explore all four directions
        const found = dfs(i + 1, j, index + 1) || // Down
                      dfs(i - 1, j, index + 1) || // Up
                      dfs(i, j + 1, index + 1) || // Right
                      dfs(i, j - 1, index + 1);   // Left

        // Backtrack: Unmark the cell
        board[i][j] = temp; // Restore original value

        return found;
    };

    // Start DFS from each cell
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === word[0] && dfs(i, j, 0)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    return false; // Word not found
};
Explanation of the Code
The exist function initializes the dimensions of the board and defines the DFS helper function.
The dfs function checks for boundary conditions, matches characters, and recursively searches in all four directions.
Each time a character matches, we mark the cell to avoid revisiting it during the current path.
After exploring, we backtrack by restoring the original cell value.
Finally, we iterate through each cell of the grid and call dfs to check if the word can be formed starting from that cell.
Complexity
Time Complexity: O(m * n * 4^L), where L is the length of the word. In the worst case, we might explore all possible paths, but pruning helps reduce the number of unnecessary paths.
Space Complexity: O(L) for the recursion stack, where L is the length of the word.
Conclusion
This approach efficiently finds whether the word exists in the grid using DFS and backtracking with pruning, ensuring that we do not explore unnecessary paths.
