To generate an 
𝑛
×
𝑛
n×n matrix filled with elements from 1 to 
𝑛
2
n 
2
  in spiral order, we can take an efficient approach similar to the traversal logic in the previous "Spiral Matrix" problem. The key difference is that we are filling in a new matrix rather than reading from an existing one.

Approach
Define boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right edges.
Initialize a matrix of size 
𝑛
×
𝑛
n×n filled with zeroes to store the result.
Iterate through numbers from 1 to 
𝑛
2
n 
2
 , placing each number into the matrix in a spiral pattern.
Traverse left to right along the top boundary, then increment top.
Traverse top to bottom along the right boundary, then decrement right.
Traverse right to left along the bottom boundary, then decrement bottom.
Traverse bottom to top along the left boundary, then increment left.
Repeat these steps until all numbers from 1 to 
𝑛
2
n 
2
  are placed.
Complexity
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ), since we visit each cell once.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ), for the output matrix.
Code Implementation
Here’s the optimized solution in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var generateMatrix = function(n) {
    const matrix = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0)); // Initialize n x n matrix with 0s
    let top = 0, bottom = n - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    let num = 1; // Start with number 1

    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Fill top row from left to right
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            matrix[top][i] = num++;
        }
        top++;

        // Fill right column from top to bottom
        for (let i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            matrix[i][right] = num++;
        }
        right--;

        // Fill bottom row from right to left
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (let i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                matrix[bottom][i] = num++;
            }
            bottom--;
        }

        // Fill left column from bottom to top
        if (left <= right) {
            for (let i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                matrix[i][left] = num++;
            }
            left++;
        }
    }

    return matrix;
};
Explanation
The top, bottom, left, and right variables define the boundaries within which we fill the matrix.
As we spiral inward, we adjust each boundary (top, bottom, left, right) to move closer to the center.
We increment num as we place each element, ensuring we fill numbers from 1 to 
𝑛
2
n 
2
  in the correct order.
Example Walkthrough
For 
𝑛
=
3
n=3:

Initialize the boundaries: top = 0, bottom = 2, left = 0, right = 2.
Traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern, filling in numbers until we reach 
9
9:
First row left-to-right → [1, 2, 3]
Right column top-to-bottom → [4, 5]
Bottom row right-to-left → [6, 7]
Left column bottom-to-top → [8], and then the center → [9]
This approach is efficient for filling a spiral matrix in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 ) time.
