The code you've written for finding the maximum product of a subarray is almost correct, but there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

Issues in the Code:
Initialization of maxProduct and minProduct: The initialization of maxProduct and minProduct should account for negative numbers effectively. In your code, you initialize them both to nums[0], which is fine, but the logic to handle negative numbers in the for loop needs to correctly compute the maximum and minimum products.

Updating maxProduct: The update for maxProduct after the swap of maxProduct and minProduct should be Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] * maxProduct) to ensure that you're considering the possibility of starting a new subarray.

Order of operations: You should update maxProduct before updating minProduct, especially since you swap them when a negative number is encountered.

Update of finalProduct: You should update finalProduct after both maxProduct and minProduct have been updated in each iteration to ensure it always holds the maximum product found so far.

Revised Code:
Here's the corrected version of your code:

javascript
Copy code
var maxProduct = function(nums) {
    let finalProduct = nums[0];
    let maxProduct = nums[0];
    let minProduct = nums[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] < 0) {
            // Swap max and min
            [maxProduct, minProduct] = [minProduct, maxProduct];
        }

        // Calculate the new max and min products
        maxProduct = Math.max(nums[i], nums[i] * maxProduct);
        minProduct = Math.min(nums[i], nums[i] * minProduct);

        // Update finalProduct with the maximum found so far
        finalProduct = Math.max(finalProduct, maxProduct);
    }

    return finalProduct;
};

// Example Usage
console.log(maxProduct([2, 3, -2, 4])); // Output: 6
console.log(maxProduct([-2, 0, -1]));   // Output: 0
Explanation of Changes:
Handling Negatives: The swap of maxProduct and minProduct occurs correctly before updating them.
Max/Min Calculation: Each iteration recalculates maxProduct and minProduct correctly considering the current number nums[i].
Final Product Update: finalProduct is updated to keep track of the maximum product encountered.
Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the length of the input array nums. The algorithm goes through the array only once.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) because we're using a constant amount of extra space for the variables.
This implementation should correctly compute the maximum product of any contiguous subarray within the input nums.
