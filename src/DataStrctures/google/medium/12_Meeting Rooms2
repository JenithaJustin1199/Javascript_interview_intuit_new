To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of conference rooms required to accommodate a given set of meeting time intervals, we can utilize a sweep line algorithm combined with a priority queue (or min-heap) to manage the end times of ongoing meetings. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach:

Approach
Sort the Intervals: First, sort the meeting intervals based on their start times. This will allow us to process the meetings in the order they begin.

Use a Min-Heap: We will use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the end times of meetings that are currently ongoing. The min-heap allows us to efficiently determine when the earliest meeting ends.

Iterate Through Meetings:

For each meeting, check if the room associated with the earliest ending meeting (the root of the min-heap) is free. If the current meeting starts after the earliest meeting ends, pop the heap (remove the earliest end time) as that room is now available.
Push the current meeting's end time into the min-heap. If the room was not free, it means we need an additional room.
Count the Rooms: The size of the min-heap at any point in time will represent the number of rooms currently being used. The maximum size of the min-heap during the process will give us the minimum number of rooms required.

Implementation
Here’s the JavaScript implementation of the above approach:

javascript
Copy code
function minMeetingRooms(intervals) {
    if (intervals.length === 0) return 0;

    // Initialize a min-heap
    const endTimes = [];
    
    // Sort the meetings in increasing order of their start times
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Add the end time of the first meeting
    endTimes.push(intervals[0][1]);

    for (let i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
        // If the meeting starts after the earliest meeting ends, reuse the room
        if (intervals[i][0] >= endTimes[0]) {
            endTimes.shift(); // Remove the room that got free
        }

        // Add the current meeting's end time to the min-heap
        endTimes.push(intervals[i][1]);

        // Keep the heap sorted by end times
        endTimes.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }

    // The size of the min-heap is the number of rooms needed
    return endTimes.length;
}
Explanation of the Code
Sort the Intervals: We sort the intervals based on the start time.
Manage End Times with a Min-Heap:
We initially add the end time of the first meeting.
For each subsequent meeting, we check if it can use a room that has become available (if its start time is greater than or equal to the earliest end time).
We update the min-heap with the new meeting's end time.
Return the Number of Rooms: The number of rooms required is determined by the size of the heap at the end.
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:

Sorting the intervals takes 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn), where 
𝑛
n is the number of meetings.
Each meeting is added to and removed from the heap at most once, making the heap operations 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn).
Overall, the time complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(nlogn).
Space Complexity:

The space complexity is 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) for the min-heap in the worst case (if all meetings overlap and we need a separate room for each).
Conclusion
This approach is efficient for the given problem constraints and ensures that we use the minimum number of conference rooms required for the overlapping meetings.
