To determine if a graph forms a valid tree, we need to verify two conditions:

No Cycles: A tree cannot contain cycles.
Connected Graph: All nodes must be reachable from any starting node (one connected component).
With n nodes and edges, we can apply these checks:

For a graph to be a tree, it should have exactly 
𝑛
−
1
n−1 edges. If it has fewer, it’s disconnected; if more, there must be a cycle.
We can use DFS or Union-Find to check for cycles and connectivity.
Solution using Union-Find
Union-Find (or Disjoint Set Union) is an efficient method for this problem, especially when checking for cycles in an undirected graph. Here’s the approach:

Initialize a Union-Find Structure:

Each node starts as its own parent.
Use union-by-rank and path compression for efficient union and find operations.
Process Each Edge:

For each edge (a, b), check if a and b are already connected (i.e., they have the same root).
If they are connected, a cycle is present.
Otherwise, union a and b.
Final Check:

If there are exactly 
𝑛
−
1
n−1 edges and no cycles, then all nodes are connected, and it’s a valid tree.
Code Implementation
Here’s the code in JavaScript to check if a graph is a valid tree using the Union-Find approach:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {number} n - number of nodes
 * @param {number[][]} edges - array of edges
 * @return {boolean} - true if the graph is a valid tree, otherwise false
 */
var validTree = function(n, edges) {
    // If the number of edges isn't n - 1, it can't be a tree
    if (edges.length !== n - 1) return false;

    // Initialize Union-Find structure
    const parent = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i);

    // Find function with path compression
    function find(x) {
        if (parent[x] !== x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    // Union function
    function union(x, y) {
        const rootX = find(x);
        const rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX === rootY) return false; // Cycle detected
        parent[rootX] = rootY; // Union the two nodes
        return true;
    }

    // Process each edge
    for (const [a, b] of edges) {
        if (!union(a, b)) return false; // Cycle found
    }

    return true; // No cycle and n - 1 edges, so it's a valid tree
};
Explanation of the Code
Union-Find Setup:

parent array is initialized with each node as its own parent.
The find function uses path compression to make future queries faster.
The union function checks if two nodes are in the same set (indicating a cycle if they are) and merges sets if not.
Edge Processing:

We iterate through each edge and use union to join nodes.
If a union operation returns false, it means there’s already a connection between the two nodes, indicating a cycle.
Final Return:

If we complete processing without finding a cycle and the edge count is 
𝑛
−
1
n−1, it’s a valid tree.
