To solve the "Reverse Linked List II" problem efficiently, we can approach it with a single-pass algorithm and make in-place modifications to the linked list. Here’s how we can solve it in 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) time complexity with 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) space complexity.

Approach:
Edge Cases:

If head is null or if left is equal to right, there’s no need to reverse, so we can directly return the head.
Identify the Sublist to Reverse:

Traverse the list until reaching the left-1 position, which is the node just before the start of the reversal.
Keep track of this node (prevLeft) and the left-th node (leftNode), which will eventually be the end of the reversed sublist.
Reverse the Sublist:

From the left-th to the right-th node, reverse the pointers of each node in this sublist.
After the reversal, leftNode becomes the last node in the reversed sublist, and rightNode (initially the left-th node) becomes the first.
Reconnect the Sublist:

Connect prevLeft to rightNode.
Connect leftNode (which is now the end of the reversed sublist) to the node after rightNode.
Return the Updated List:

If left is 1, it means the head node has changed after reversal, so return rightNode as the new head.
Otherwise, return the original head.
Code Implementation:
javascript
Copy code
var reverseBetween = function(head, left, right) {
    if (!head || left === right) return head;

    let dummy = new ListNode(0); // Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases
    dummy.next = head;
    let prevLeft = dummy;

    // Step 1: Move prevLeft to the node before left
    for (let i = 1; i < left; i++) {
        prevLeft = prevLeft.next;
    }

    // Step 2: Start the reversal from leftNode to rightNode
    let current = prevLeft.next;
    let prev = null;
    for (let i = 0; i <= right - left; i++) {
        let nextTemp = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = nextTemp;
    }

    // Step 3: Reconnect the reversed sublist with the rest of the list
    prevLeft.next.next = current; // Connect leftNode's next to current (node after right)
    prevLeft.next = prev;         // Connect prevLeft to rightNode (new head of reversed sublist)

    return dummy.next;
};
Explanation of the Code:
Dummy Node: We add a dummy node before head to handle edge cases where left is 1 (reversing from the head).
Traverse to prevLeft: Move prevLeft to just before the left-th node.
Reverse the Sublist: Reverse the pointers between nodes from left to right.
Reconnect: Connect the nodes correctly after reversing.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the number of nodes, as we only traverse the list once.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1), as we’re only using a few pointers without any additional data structures.
This solution is optimal as it performs the reversal in-place with minimal auxiliary space.
