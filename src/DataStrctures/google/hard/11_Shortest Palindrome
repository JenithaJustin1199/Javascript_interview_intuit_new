To solve the Shortest Palindrome problem efficiently, we can utilize a combination of string reversal and a pattern-matching technique (like the KMP algorithm).

Approach
The idea is to determine the longest prefix of the given string s that is also a palindrome. By finding this prefix, we can identify the minimum suffix that needs to be mirrored at the beginning of s to make it a palindrome.

Reverse the String:

Let rev_s be the reverse of the string s.
Concatenate s and rev_s with a Special Character:

We create a new string temp that is a combination of s + "#" + rev_s.
The # acts as a delimiter to prevent overlapping issues between s and rev_s.
Use the KMP Algorithm to Find the Longest Prefix:

We use the prefix-suffix array (KMP Table) for temp, which helps identify the longest prefix of temp that matches a suffix.
The value at the last index of this prefix-suffix array tells us the length of the longest palindromic prefix in s.
Construct the Shortest Palindrome:

To create the shortest palindrome, we take the non-palindromic suffix (from s after the longest palindromic prefix), reverse it, and append it to the front of s.
Code Implementation
Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var shortestPalindrome = function(s) {
    let rev_s = s.split("").reverse().join("");
    let temp = s + "#" + rev_s;
    
    // KMP table
    let n = temp.length;
    let lps = Array(n).fill(0); // Longest Prefix Suffix array
    
    // Building the LPS array
    for (let i = 1, len = 0; i < n; ) {
        if (temp[i] === temp[len]) {
            len++;
            lps[i] = len;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (len !== 0) {
                len = lps[len - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find the non-palindromic suffix
    let longest_palindromic_prefix_len = lps[n - 1];
    let suffix = s.slice(longest_palindromic_prefix_len);
    
    // Append the reverse of suffix to the front of s
    return suffix.split("").reverse().join("") + s;
};
Explanation
Reverse and Concatenate:

For s = "abcd", we get rev_s = "dcba" and temp = "abcd#dcba".
Building the KMP Table:

The KMP table (lps array) for temp helps find the longest palindrome that starts from the beginning of s.
In this example, lps tells us the longest prefix of s that is also a suffix of temp.
Construct the Result:

Based on the lps array, we know the characters of s that are not part of the palindromic prefix.
Reverse this suffix and prepend it to s.
Complexity
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) because we only need to build the KMP table once.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) for the lps array and the concatenated string temp.
This solution is efficient and leverages KMP to find the longest palindromic prefix in linear time, making it ideal for handling large inputs.
