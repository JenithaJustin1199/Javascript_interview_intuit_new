The key observation here is that every position in the target array can be seen as a combination of incremental steps applied to subarrays. Let's focus on individual elements:

If at index i, the value of target[i] is larger than target[i - 1], it means that starting from position i - 1, we need extra increments to bring that value up to target[i].
Conversely, if target[i] <= target[i - 1], no extra operation is needed at i because the increment from previous operations is sufficient.
Thus, for each index i, the number of operations required to bring target[i] to the desired value depends on how much larger target[i] is compared to target[i - 1].

Algorithm:
Start with an initial count of operations set to target[0]. This is because we need at least target[0] operations to bring the first element to target[0] from 0.
For every index i from 1 to n-1:
If target[i] > target[i - 1], we need additional operations to bring target[i] to its value. The extra operations needed are target[i] - target[i - 1].
In other words, at every step, we only care about how much larger each target[i] is compared to its previous value.

Hint
You are given an integer array target. You have an integer array initial of the same size as target with all elements initially zeros.

In one operation you can choose any subarray from initial and increment each value by one.

Return the minimum number of operations to form a target array from initial.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = [1,2,3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We need at least 3 operations to form the target array from the initial array.
[0,0,0,0,0] increment 1 from index 0 to 4 (inclusive).
[1,1,1,1,1] increment 1 from index 1 to 3 (inclusive).
[1,2,2,2,1] increment 1 at index 2.
[1,2,3,2,1] target array is formed.
Example 2:

Input: target = [3,1,1,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: [0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1] -> [1,1,1,2] -> [2,1,1,2] -> [3,1,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: target = [3,1,5,4,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: [0,0,0,0,0] -> [1,1,1,1,1] -> [2,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,1,1,1] -> [3,1,2,2,2] -> [3,1,3,3,2] -> [3,1,4,4,2] -> [3,1,5,4,2].


function minNumberOperations(target) {
    let operations = target[0]; // Start with the first element

    for (let i = 1; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
            operations += target[i] - target[i - 1]; // Increment needed to raise target[i]
        }
    }

    return operations;
}

// Example
let target = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1];
console.log(minNumberOperations(target)); // Output: 3
Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
The algorithm iterates over the entire array exactly once, making it a linear time algorithm where n is the size of the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1)
The algorithm uses only a constant amount of space regardless of the size of the input array (a few variables to store counters and the array index).



Dynamic Programming Approach:
We will use a DP array where each element dp[i] will store the minimum number of operations required to form the subarray target[0..i].

Let's build the solution step by step.

Observation:
To reach the target array, the key observation is the difference between adjacent elements.
If target[i] > target[i - 1], then additional operations are required to increase the value at i from target[i - 1] to target[i].
If target[i] <= target[i - 1], no extra operations are needed because previous increments (from index i - 1) are sufficient to keep the value at target[i].
Steps for DP Approach:
Initialize:

We initialize dp[0] to target[0] because, to achieve the first element from 0 to target[0], we need exactly target[0] operations.
DP Recurrence:

For each subsequent element i from 1 to n-1, if target[i] > target[i-1], then we need target[i] - target[i-1] additional operations. Otherwise, no additional operations are needed.
This gives us the recurrence:
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (target[i] - target[i-1]) if target[i] > target[i-1].
dp[i] = dp[i-1] if target[i] <= target[i-1].
Result:

The value of dp[n-1] (the last element in the DP array) will give the minimum number of operations needed to form the target array.
Dynamic Programming Solution in JavaScript:

Copy code
function minNumberOperations(target) {
    // Edge case: if the target array is empty, no operations are needed
    if (target.length === 0) return 0;
    
    // Initialize the dp array
    let dp = new Array(target.length).fill(0);
    
    // First element in the target array needs target[0] operations
    dp[0] = target[0];
    
    // Fill the dp array using the recurrence relation
    for (let i = 1; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + (target[i] - target[i - 1]);
        } else {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1]; // No extra operations needed if target[i] <= target[i - 1]
        }
    }
    
    // The result is the last element of the dp array
    return dp[target.length - 1];
}

// Example
let target = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1];
console.log(minNumberOperations(target));  // Output: 3
Explanation:
dp[0] is initialized to target[0] because that's the minimum number of operations needed to reach the first element.
For each subsequent element target[i]:
If target[i] is greater than target[i - 1], we need target[i] - target[i - 1] extra operations to bring target[i] to its required value.
Otherwise, no extra operations are needed, and we just carry forward the value from dp[i - 1].
This way, the DP array keeps track of the minimum number of operations needed at each point in the target array.

Time Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
We iterate through the array once, updating the dp array based on the recurrence relation. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the target array, which is O(n).
Space Complexity:
Space Complexity: O(n)
We are using a DP array of size n to store the number of operations at each index. Hence, the space complexity is O(n).
