To solve the Shuffle the Array problem optimally, we need to rearrange the elements of the nums array such that the elements in the form [x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn] become [x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn].

Solution Approach
Initialize a Result Array: Create an empty result array to store the shuffled values.
Interleave Elements: Use a loop to interleave the elements from the two halves:
For each i from 0 to n-1, push nums[i] (from the first half) and nums[i + n] (from the second half) into the result array.
Return the Result: After the loop, the result array will have the desired format.
Code
Here's the JavaScript implementation of the optimized solution:

javascript
Copy code
function shuffle(nums, n) {
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result.push(nums[i], nums[i + n]);
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(shuffle([2,5,1,3,4,7], 3)); // Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7]
console.log(shuffle([1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], 4)); // Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]
console.log(shuffle([1,1,2,2], 2)); // Output: [1,2,1,2]
Explanation with Example
For nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7] and n = 3:

Initialize an empty result array.
For each i from 0 to 2:
Add nums[i] and nums[i + 3] to result.
Result becomes [2,3,5,4,1,7].
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), where 
𝑛
n is the input n value, because we loop through half of the nums array.
Space Complexity: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n), for storing the result array.
This approach is efficient and straightforward, meeting the problem’s constraints.
