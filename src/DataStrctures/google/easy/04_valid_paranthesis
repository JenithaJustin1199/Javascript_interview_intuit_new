To solve the Valid Parentheses problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the open brackets, ensuring that each closing bracket correctly matches the most recent open bracket.

Solution Approach
Stack for Matching Brackets:

Traverse the string character by character.
If an open bracket ((, {, [) is encountered, push it onto the stack.
If a close bracket (), }, ]) is encountered, check the top of the stack:
If the stack is empty (indicating there's no corresponding open bracket), return false.
If the top of the stack matches the open bracket for the encountered close bracket, pop the stack.
If it doesn‚Äôt match, return false.
Final Check:

After traversing the string, if the stack is empty, return true (indicating all brackets were matched). If the stack is not empty, return false.
var isValid = function(s) {
    const stack = [];
    const bracketMap = {
        '(': ')',
        '{': '}',
        '[': ']'
    };

    for (let char of s) {
        if (bracketMap[char]) {
            // If the character is an open bracket, push its matching close bracket onto the stack
            stack.push(bracketMap[char]);
        } else {
            // If it's a close bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
            if (stack.pop() !== char) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched; otherwise, return false
    return stack.length === 0;
};
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n), where 
ùëõ
n is the length of the string. Each character is processed once, either pushed onto or popped from the stack.
Space Complexity: O(n), where 
ùëõ
n is the length of the string, for the stack to store unmatched opening brackets.
This approach efficiently checks if the parentheses are balanced and correctly matched.
