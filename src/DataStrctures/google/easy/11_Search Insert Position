To solve the problem of finding the search insert position for a target value in a sorted array of distinct integers, we can implement a modified binary search algorithm. The goal is to return the index if the target is found or the index where it would be inserted in order if it's not found.

Here's a modified version of your existing code that correctly implements this logic:

Implementation
javascript
Copy code
var searchInsert = function(nums, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid; // Target found, return its index
        }
        
        if (target < nums[mid]) {
            right = mid - 1; // Target is in the left half
        } else {
            left = mid + 1; // Target is in the right half
        }
    }
    
    // At the end of the loop, left is the insert position
    return left; 
};
Explanation
Initialization: We initialize two pointers, left and right, to mark the bounds of the search space.
Binary Search Loop: The loop continues while left is less than or equal to right:
Calculate the middle index mid.
If the element at mid is equal to the target, we return mid.
If the target is less than nums[mid], we move the right pointer to mid - 1 to search the left half.
If the target is greater than nums[mid], we move the left pointer to mid + 1 to search the right half.
Insertion Point: If the loop ends without finding the target, left will be positioned at the index where the target should be inserted. We return left as the result.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The time complexity is O(log n) due to the binary search approach.
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space.
