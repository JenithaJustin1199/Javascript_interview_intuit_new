To solve the "Add Digits" problem in an optimized way, we can use a mathematical approach that avoids loops or recursion, achieving an 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) runtime.

Explanation:
This problem is related to digital root in mathematics. The digital root of a number can be found using a formula based on modulus operations.

Key Insight:
The digital root of a number can be calculated as follows:

If the number is 0, the digital root is 0.
For any other number, the digital root can be calculated as:
digital root
=
1
+
(
𝑛
𝑢
𝑚
−
1
)
%
9
digital root=1+(num−1)%9
This formula works because numbers in base 10 repeat in cycles of 9 for their digital roots.

Why It Works:
For any number, repeatedly adding its digits until one digit remains is equivalent to computing:

𝑛
𝑢
𝑚
m
o
d
 
 
9
nummod9
However, because num % 9 can give 0 for numbers like 9, 18, 27, etc., we adjust it to return 9 instead of 0 when num is a multiple of 9.

Optimized Solution:
Here's the solution based on the formula above:

javascript
Copy code
var addDigits = function(num) {
    if (num === 0) return 0;
    return 1 + (num - 1) % 9;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(addDigits(38)); // Output: 2
console.log(addDigits(0));  // Output: 0
Explanation of the Code:
If num is 0, return 0 immediately.
Otherwise, use the formula 1 + (num - 1) % 9 to compute the digital root in 
𝑂
(
1
)
O(1) time.
This method is highly efficient and avoids iterative or recursive methods, directly giving the result.


if(num==0)
    return 0;
if(num%9==0)
    return 9;
else
    return (num%9);
