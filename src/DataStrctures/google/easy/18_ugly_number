An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

To determine if a number 
𝑛
n is an ugly number, we need to check if it only has prime factors 2, 3, and 5. This can be done by dividing 
𝑛
n by 2, 3, or 5 repeatedly until it no longer divides evenly. If we end up with 1, 
𝑛
n is an ugly number; otherwise, it is not.

Solution
javascript
Copy code
var isUgly = function(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return false;

    // Divide n by 2, 3, and 5 as long as it is divisible by them
    for (const factor of [2, 3, 5]) {
        while (n % factor === 0) {
            n /= factor;
        }
    }

    // If n has been reduced to 1, it is an ugly number
    return n === 1;
};
Explanation
We first check if 
𝑛
n is less than or equal to 0. Negative numbers and zero are not considered ugly numbers, so we return false.
We then iterate through the factors [2, 3, 5] and repeatedly divide 
𝑛
n by each factor as long as it’s divisible by that factor.
After all divisions, if 
𝑛
n is reduced to 1, it means all prime factors of 
𝑛
n were 2, 3, or 5, so we return true. Otherwise, we return false.
