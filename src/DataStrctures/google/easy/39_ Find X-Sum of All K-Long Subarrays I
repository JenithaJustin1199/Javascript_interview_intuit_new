To solve this problem, we need to calculate the "x-sum" for each k-length subarray of nums. The x-sum is obtained by counting the occurrences of each element in the subarray and summing the most frequent x elements. Here’s a more efficient approach to accomplish this in JavaScript.

Optimized Approach
Sliding Window:

Use a sliding window of size k to iterate over each subarray of nums.
As the window moves forward, add the new element and remove the oldest element.
Element Count Management:

Maintain a frequency map to count occurrences of each element in the current window.
As elements are added and removed from the window, update this frequency map.
Priority Sorting:

For each window, calculate the x-sum by sorting the elements in the frequency map by frequency (and by value if the frequency is the same) to get the x most frequent elements.
Edge Cases:

If there are fewer than x distinct elements in the window, sum all distinct elements.
Time Complexity
Sorting each subarray’s elements by frequency and value results in O(k log k) per window. This approach should be efficient given the constraints 
𝑛
≤
50
n≤50.

Implementation
Here’s the JavaScript code for the optimized solution:

javascript
Copy code
function getXSum(nums, k, x) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let answer = [];

    // Helper function to calculate the x-sum of the current frequency map
    function calculateXSum(freqMap) {
        // Sort elements by frequency and value (descending)
        let sorted = Array.from(freqMap.entries())
            .sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1] || b[0] - a[0]);
        
        let sum = 0;
        let count = 0;

        // Sum the top `x` most frequent elements
        for (let [num, freq] of sorted) {
            if (count >= x) break;
            sum += num * freq;
            count += 1;
        }

        return sum;
    }

    // Initialize frequency map for the first window
    let freqMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        freqMap.set(nums[i], (freqMap.get(nums[i]) || 0) + 1);
    }
    answer.push(calculateXSum(freqMap));

    // Slide the window across `nums`
    for (let i = k; i < n; i++) {
        // Add the new element
        freqMap.set(nums[i], (freqMap.get(nums[i]) || 0) + 1);

        // Remove the old element
        let oldElement = nums[i - k];
        if (freqMap.get(oldElement) === 1) {
            freqMap.delete(oldElement);
        } else {
            freqMap.set(oldElement, freqMap.get(oldElement) - 1);
        }

        // Calculate x-sum for the current window and add to the answer
        answer.push(calculateXSum(freqMap));
    }

    return answer;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(getXSum([1,1,2,2,3,4,2,3], 6, 2)); // Output: [6, 10, 12]
console.log(getXSum([3,8,7,8,7,5], 2, 2));     // Output: [11, 15, 15, 15, 12]
Explanation of Code
calculateXSum function:
This function takes a frequency map as input, sorts it based on frequency and value, and sums the top x most frequent elements.
Main Loop:
Initialize the frequency map for the first k elements and calculate the x-sum.
For each subsequent window, update the frequency map by adding the new element and removing the old one, then compute the x-sum.
This approach ensures that we achieve the optimized solution using efficient counting and sorting for each window.
