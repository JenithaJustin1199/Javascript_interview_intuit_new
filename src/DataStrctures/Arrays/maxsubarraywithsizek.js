To find the maximum of all subarrays of size k in an array, you can use a sliding window approach with a double-ended queue (Deque). The idea is to maintain a deque that stores the indices of elements in the current window in decreasing order of their values. Here's the approach and the JavaScript code:

Approach:

Create an empty deque to store the indices of elements in the current window.
Iterate through the array and do the following for each element:
Remove elements from the back of the deque until the deque is not empty and the current element is greater than the element at the back of the deque.
Add the current element's index to the back of the deque.
If the index at the front of the deque is outside the current window, remove it.
If the current index is greater than or equal to k - 1, add the maximum element in the current window to the result.
The result contains the maximum elements for all subarrays of size k.
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function maxOfSubarrays(arr, k) {
  const result = [];
  const deque = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // Remove elements from the back of the deque until the current element is greater
    while (deque.length > 0 && arr[i] > arr[deque[deque.length - 1]]) {
      deque.pop();
    }

    // Add the current element's index to the back of the deque
    deque.push(i);

    // Remove elements from the front of the deque if outside the current window
    while (deque.length > 0 && deque[0] <= i - k) {
      deque.shift();
    }

    // If the current index is greater than or equal to k - 1, add the maximum element to the result
    if (i >= k - 1) {
      result.push(arr[deque[0]]);
    }
  }

  return result;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6];
const k = 3;
const output = maxOfSubarrays(arr, k);
console.log(output);  // Output: [3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6]
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The algorithm processes each element once and maintains the deque in a way that ensures constant time complexity for each element.
