
Approach:

To solve this problem, we can use a hashmap to store the complement of each element as we iterate through the array. The complement is the difference between the target value and the current element. If we encounter an element for which the complement exists in the hashmap, we have found the pair of indices that add up to the target.

Use Hashmap:

Iterate through the array, and for each element, calculate its complement (target - current element).
Check if the complement exists in the hashmap. If it does, we have found the pair.
If the complement is not in the hashmap, store the current element along with its index.
Result:

Return the indices of the two elements that form the target sum.
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  // Create a hashmap to store each element and its index
  const numMap = new Map();

  // Iterate through the array
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    // Calculate the complement for the current element
    const complement = target - nums[i];

    // Check if the complement exists in the hashmap
    if (numMap.has(complement)) {
      // Return the indices of the pair
      return [numMap.get(complement), i];
    }

    // Store the current element and its index in the hashmap
    numMap.set(nums[i], i);
  }

  // It is guaranteed that each input has exactly one solution,
  // so we do not need to handle the case where no solution is found.

  // This return statement should not be reached if the input is valid.
  return [];
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
console.log(twoSum(nums, target)); // Output: [0, 1]
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and each lookup and insertion operation in the hashmap takes constant time on average. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the array length.
