Approach:

Check if Subset Sums are Possible:

If the total sum of the array is odd, it's not possible to divide the array into two subsets with equal sum. In this case, return false.
If the total sum is even, proceed with the recursive backtracking.
Backtracking Function:

Create a backtracking function that explores two possibilities: including the current element in one subset or excluding it.
Recursive Exploration:

Recursively explore both possibilities, updating the current sum and the index of the current element.
Result:

If any recursive call results in finding two subsets with equal sum, return true. Otherwise, return false at the end of the function.
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function canPartition(nums) {
  // Calculate the total sum of the array
  const totalSum = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

  // If the total sum is odd, it's not possible to divide into two equal subsets
  if (totalSum % 2 !== 0) {
    return false;
  }

  // Calculate the target sum for each subset
  const target = totalSum / 2;

  // Sort the array in descending order to improve backtracking efficiency
  nums.sort((a, b) => b - a);

  // Backtracking function to explore possibilities
  function backtrack(index, currentSum) {
    // Base case: If the current sum equals the target, two equal subsets are found
    if (currentSum === target) {
      return true;
    }

    // Recursive exploration: include or exclude the current element
    for (let i = index; i < nums.length; i++) {
      if (currentSum + nums[i] <= target) {
        if (backtrack(i + 1, currentSum + nums[i])) {
          return true; // Found two equal subsets
        }
      }
    }

    return false; // No equal subsets found
  }

  // Start the backtracking from the beginning
  return backtrack(0, 0);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(canPartition([1, 5, 11, 5])); // Output: true
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is exponential, O(2^n), where n is the length of the array. This is because, in the worst case, the backtracking function explores all possible subsets. The recursive calls lead to an exponential number of function calls, making it less efficient compared to the dynamic programming approach.

  Approach:

Check if Subset Sums are Possible:

If the total sum of the array is odd, it's not possible to divide the array into two subsets with equal sum. In this case, return false.
If the total sum is even, create a 2D array dp to track if a subset sum is possible for each sum from 0 to half of the total sum.
Dynamic Programming - Subset Sum:

Use dynamic programming to fill the dp array. dp[i][j] represents whether it's possible to get a sum of j using the first i elements of the array.
The recurrence relation is: dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || dp[i - 1][j - nums[i]].
Result:

If dp[n][target] is true, where n is the length of the array and target is half of the total sum, it means it's possible to divide the array into two subsets with equal sum.
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function canPartition(nums) {
  // Calculate the total sum of the array
  const totalSum = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

  // If the total sum is odd, it's not possible to divide into two equal subsets
  if (totalSum % 2 !== 0) {
    return false;
  }

  // Calculate the target sum for each subset
  const target = totalSum / 2;

  // Initialize a 2D array to track subset sums
  const n = nums.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(target + 1).fill(false));

  // Base case: It's always possible to get a sum of 0
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i][0] = true;
  }

  // Dynamic programming to fill the dp array
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= target; j++) {
      dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
      if (j >= nums[i - 1]) {
        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] || dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]];
      }
    }
  }

  // The final result is whether it's possible to get a sum of target using all elements
  return dp[n][target];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(canPartition([1, 5, 11, 5])); // Output: true
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n * target), where n is the length of the array, and target is the total sum divided by 2. The dynamic programming approach involves filling a 2D array of size (n + 1) x (target + 1), and each cell takes constant time to fill. Therefore, the overall time complexity is proportional to the product of the array length and the target sum.
