Approach:

If the array is empty, return an empty string (there is no common prefix).
Initialize the prefix as the first string in the array.
Iterate through the remaining strings and update the prefix by comparing characters.
If a mismatch is found or the end of any string is reached, update the prefix accordingly.
After iterating through all strings, the current prefix is the longest common prefix.
Code with Comments:

python
Copy code
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    # If the array is empty, return an empty string
    if not strs:
        return ""

    # Initialize the prefix as the first string
    prefix = strs[0]

    # Iterate through the remaining strings
    for string in strs[1:]:
        i = 0

        # Compare characters until a mismatch is found or the end of any string is reached
        while i < len(prefix) and i < len(string) and prefix[i] == string[i]:
            i += 1

        # Update the prefix to the common characters
        prefix = prefix[:i]

        # If the prefix becomes an empty string, no common prefix exists
        if prefix == "":
            break

    return prefix

# Example usage:
strings = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]
result = longestCommonPrefix(strings)
print(result)  # Output: "fl"
In this example, the longestCommonPrefix function takes an array of strings and iterates through them, updating the prefix by comparing characters. The final prefix is the longest common prefix among all strings.

Time Complexity:

Let m be the length of the longest string in the array, and n be the number of strings in the array. The time complexity of this approach is O(m * n), where each character is compared at most once for each string.
