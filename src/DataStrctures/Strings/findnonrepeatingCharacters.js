To find the non-repeating element in the given array where every element is repeated twice except for one, and repeating elements are clubbed together, you can use a binary search-like approach.

Approach:

Observation:

Due to the repeating nature of elements and the grouping of repeating elements together, we can observe that the non-repeating element will always be at an odd index.
Binary Search-like Approach:

Perform a modified binary search where you check elements at mid, mid-1, mid+1 indices to determine which side of the array to continue searching.
Check Mid, Mid-1, Mid+1:

If the element at the mid index is the non-repeating element, return it.
If mid and mid-1 elements are equal, the non-repeating element is on the right side.
If mid and mid+1 elements are equal, the non-repeating element is on the left side.
Binary Search on the Relevant Side:

Continue the search on the relevant side based on the observations.
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function findNonRepeating(arr) {
  let low = 0;
  let high = arr.length - 1;

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);

    // Check if the element at mid is the non-repeating element
    if (arr[mid] !== arr[mid - 1] && arr[mid] !== arr[mid + 1]) {
      return arr[mid];
    }

    // Check if the non-repeating element is on the right side
    if ((mid % 2 === 0 && arr[mid] === arr[mid + 1]) || (mid % 2 === 1 && arr[mid] === arr[mid - 1])) {
      low = mid + 1;
    }
    // Check if the non-repeating element is on the left side
    else {
      high = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  // This statement should not be reached if the input is valid
  return "No non-repeating element found.";
}

// Example usage:
const arr = ['u', 'u', 'i', 'i', 'k', 'k', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'f', 'h', 'h'];
const result = findNonRepeating(arr);
console.log(result); // Output: 'f'
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) due to the binary search-like approach, where n is the length of the array. The search space is reduced by half in each iteration, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.
