Approach:

Sort Characters:

Sort the characters in the input string based on their frequencies.
Interleave Characters:

Interleave the characters from the sorted array into the result string.
Check Validity:

After building the result string, check if it is valid (i.e., no two adjacent characters are the same).
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function reorganizeString(s) {
  // Count the frequency of each character
  const charCount = new Map();
  for (let char of s) {
    charCount.set(char, (charCount.get(char) || 0) + 1);
  }

  // Sort characters based on their frequencies
  const sortedChars = [...charCount.keys()].sort((a, b) => charCount.get(b) - charCount.get(a));

  // Interleave characters to build the result string
  const result = new Array(s.length);
  let index = 0;

  for (let char of sortedChars) {
    // Interleave characters based on their frequencies
    for (let count = 0; count < charCount.get(char); count++) {
      result[index] = char;
      index += 2;
      if (index >= s.length) index = 1;
    }
  }

  // Check the validity of the result string
  for (let i = 1; i < result.length; i++) {
    if (result[i] === result[i - 1]) return '';
  }

  return result.join('');
}

// Example usage
console.log(reorganizeString("aab"));
console.log(reorganizeString("aaab"));
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this implementation is O(N log A), where N is the length of the input string and A is the size of the alphabet (number of distinct characters). The sorting step takes O(A log A) time, and the interleaving step takes O(N). The space complexity is O(A) for the sorted array and the map used to store character frequencies.
