Approach:

The given problem involves decoding a string that is encoded using a specific pattern. The encoding involves representing a substring within square brackets "[...]" by repeating it a certain number of times. The approach uses a stack to keep track of intermediate results while iterating through the string.

Stack for Intermediate Results:

Initialize an empty stack to keep track of intermediate results during decoding.
Iterate Through Characters:

Iterate through each character in the input string.
Handle Digits:

If a digit (0-9) is encountered, update the current number.
Handle Opening Bracket:

If an opening bracket "[" is encountered, push the current string and current number onto the stack.
Reset the current string and current number for nested decoding.
Handle Closing Bracket:

If a closing bracket "]" is encountered, pop the previous number and previous string from the stack.
Update the current string by repeating the previous string a certain number of times.
Normal Characters:

If the character is neither a digit nor a bracket, treat it as a normal character and append it to the current string.
Final Result:

The final result is the fully decoded string.
Code with Comments:

javascript
Copy code
function decodeString(str) {
  // Initialize an empty stack to keep track of intermediate results
  let stack = [];

  // Variables to track the current number and current string being decoded
  let currNumber = 0;
  let currString = "";

  // Iterate through each character in the input string
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    // Check if the character is a digit (0-9)
    if (/\d/.test(str[i])) {
      // If a digit is found, update the current number
      currNumber = parseInt(str[i]);
    }
    // Check if the character is an opening bracket "["
    else if (str[i] == "[") {
      // Push the current string and current number onto the stack
      stack.push(currString);
      stack.push(currNumber);

      // Reset current string and current number for the nested decoding
      currString = "";
      currNumber = 0;
    }
    // Check if the character is a closing bracket "]"
    else if (str[i] == "]") {
      // Pop the previous number and previous string from the stack
      let num = stack.pop();
      let prevString = stack.pop();

      // Update the current string by repeating the previous string "num" times
      currString = prevString + currString.repeat(num);
    }
    // If the character is neither a digit nor a bracket, it is a normal character
    else {
      // Append the character to the current string
      currString += str[i];
    }
  }

  // The final result is the fully decoded string
  return currString;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(decodeString("3[a2[b]c]"));
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the input string. The algorithm iterates through each character in the input string once, and each operation inside the loop takes constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in terms of the length of the input string.
