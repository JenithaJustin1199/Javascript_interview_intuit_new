Certainly! CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout model that allows you to design complex layouts with ease. Below are the attributes you can use for both the container and items inside the container.

Flex Container Properties:
display: flex;

Defines a flex container.
flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

Establishes the main axis direction.
row: Default, left to right.
row-reverse: Right to left.
column: Top to bottom.
column-reverse: Bottom to top.
flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;

Controls whether items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.
flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap;

Shorthand for setting both flex-direction and flex-wrap.
justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;

Aligns items along the main axis.
flex-start: Start of the container.
flex-end: End of the container.
center: Center of the container.
space-between: Equal spacing between items.
space-around: Equal spacing around items.
space-evenly: Equal spacing around items, including at the start and end.
align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;

Aligns items along the cross-axis.
stretch: Default, stretches items to fill the container.
flex-start: Start of the container.
flex-end: End of the container.
center: Center of the container.
baseline: Aligns items to their baseline.
align-content: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around;

Aligns a flex container's lines within the flex container when there is extra space on the cross-axis.
Flex Item Properties:
order: <integer>;

Sets the order of a flex item. Default is 0.
flex-grow: <number>;

Specifies how a flex item should grow relative to the rest of the flex items.
flex-shrink: <number>;

Specifies how a flex item should shrink relative to the rest of the flex items.
flex-basis: <length> | auto;

Specifies the initial size of a flex item.
flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;

Shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.
align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;

Allows the default alignment to be overridden for individual flex items.
Example:
css
Copy code
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  align-content: space-around;
}

.item {
  order: 2;
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 0;
  flex-basis: auto;
  flex: 1 0 auto;
  align-self: flex-start;
}
This example sets up a flex container with various properties and defines styles for flex items. You can customize these properties based on your layout requirements.
