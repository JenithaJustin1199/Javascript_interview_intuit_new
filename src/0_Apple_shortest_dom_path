Without using a framework, create a function that finds the shortest path between two nodes in the DOM tree
Step-by-Step Algorithm
Step 1: Get ancestors of nodeA

Store each ancestor and its distance from nodeA

Step 2: Walk up from nodeB

The first ancestor also found in nodeA’s ancestor list is the LCA

Step 3: Construct the path

Go up from nodeA to LCA

Go down from LCA to nodeB
function shortestDOMPath(nodeA, nodeB) {
  if (nodeA === nodeB) return [nodeA];

  // Map ancestors of nodeA to their distance
  const ancestorsA = new Map();
  let current = nodeA;
  let distance = 0;

  while (current) {
    ancestorsA.set(current, distance++);
    current = current.parentNode;
  }

  // Traverse ancestors of nodeB to find LCA
  current = nodeB;
  distance = 0;
  let lca = null;
  let distanceToLCAFromB = 0;

  while (current) {
    if (ancestorsA.has(current)) {
      lca = current;
      distanceToLCAFromB = distance;
      break;
    }
    current = current.parentNode;
    distance++;
  }

  if (!lca) return null; // Not in same DOM tree

  // Build path from nodeA to LCA
  const pathA = [];
  current = nodeA;
  while (current !== lca) {
    pathA.push(current);
    current = current.parentNode;
  }
  pathA.push(lca);

  // Build path from LCA to nodeB
  const pathB = [];
  current = nodeB;
  while (current !== lca) {
    pathB.push(current);
    current = current.parentNode;
  }

  pathB.reverse(); // downwards

  return pathA.concat(pathB.slice(1));
}
